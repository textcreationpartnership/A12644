            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the vanity of men cannot counterpoiſe the authoritie of God, who deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring many parts of Scripture in verſe, and by his Apoſtle wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs to exerciſe our deuotion in Hymnes and ſpirituall Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, warranteth the Art to be
<pb facs="tcp:18234:4"/> good, and the vſe allowable. And therfore not onely among the Heathen, whoſe Gods were chiefly canonized by their Poets, and their Paynim Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie oracled in verſe: but euen in the Old and New Teſtament, it hath bene vſed by men of greateſt pietie, in matters of moſt deuotion. Chriſt himſelfe by making an Hymne the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of his laſt Supper, and the prologue to the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant of his paſſion, gaue his Spouſe a methode to imitate, as in the office of the Church it appeareth; and to all men a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne to know the true vſe of this meaſured and footed ſtyle. But the Diuell as he affecteth Deitie, and ſeeketh to haue all the complements of Diuine honour applyed to his ſeruice, ſo hath he among the reſt poſſeſſed alſo moſt Poets with his idle fancies. For in lieu of ſolemne and deuout
<pb facs="tcp:18234:5"/> matter, to which in dutie they owe their abilities, they now buſie themſelues in expreſſing ſuch paſſions, as onely ſerue for teſtimonies to how vnworthy affections they haue wedded their wils.

Blame me not (good Couſin) though I ſend you a blame-worthie preſent: in which the moſt that can commend it, is the good will of the writer; neither Art nor Inuention giuing it any credit. If in me this be a fault, you cannot be faultleſſe that did importune mee to commit it, and therefore you muſt beare

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Vertuous requeſts, to which your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts gaue the force of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, won me to ſatisfie your deuotion, in penning ſome little diſcourſe of the bleſſed <hi>Mary Magdalene.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other glorious examples of this Saints life, I haue made choice of her <hi>Funerall Teares,</hi> in which as ſhe moſt vttered the great vehemencie of her feruent loue to Chriſt, ſo hath ſhe giuen therein largeſt ſcope to dilate vpon the ſame: a
<pb facs="tcp:18234:110"/> theame pleaſing I hope vnto your ſelfe, and fitteſt for this time. For as paſſion, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this of loue, is in theſe dayes the chiefe commander of moſt mens actions, and the Idol to which both tongues and pennes do ſacrifice their ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed labours: ſo is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now more needfull to be intreated, than how to direct theſe humours vnto their due courſes, and to draw this floud of affections into the right cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. Paſſions I allow, and loues I approue, onely I would wiſh that men would alter their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and better their intent. For paſſions being ſequels of our nature, and allotted vnto vs as the handmaides of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, there can be no doubt, but that as their authour is good, and their end godly; ſo their
<pb facs="tcp:18234:110"/> vſe tempered in the meane, implyeth no offence. Loue is but the infancie of true charitie, yet ſucking Natures teat, and ſwathed in her bands, which then groweth to perfection, when faith beſides naturall motiues, propoſeth higher and nobler grounds of amitie. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and anger are the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie officers of proweſſe and iuſtice, courage being cold and dull, and Iuſtice in due reuenge ſlacke and careleſſe, where hate of the fault doth not make it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and anger ſetteth not an edge on the ſword that puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth or preuenteth wrongs. Deſire and hope are the parents of diligence and induſtrie, the nurſes of perſeuerance and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtancie, the ſeedes of valour &amp; magnanimitie, the death of ſloath, and the breath of all
<pb facs="tcp:18234:111"/> vertue. Feare and diſlikes are the ſcoutes of diſcretion, the harbingers of wiſedome and pollicie, killing idle repentance in the cradle, and curbing raſhneſſe with deliberation. Audacitie is the armour of ſtrength, and the guide of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, breaking the Ice to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt exployts, and crowning valour with honorable victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
                  <p>Sorrow is the ſiſter of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and a waker of compaſſion, weeping with others teares, &amp; grieued with their harmes. It is both the ſalue and ſmart of ſinne, curing that which it chaſtiſeth with true remorſe, &amp; preuenting need of new cure with the deteſtation of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Deſpaire of the ſucceſſe, is a bitte againſt euill attempts, and the hearſe of idle hopes,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:111"/> ending endleſſe things in their firſt motion, to begin. True ioy is the reſt and reward of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſeaſoning difficulties with delight, and giuing a preſent aſſay of future happineſſe. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, there is no paſsion but hath a ſeruiceable vſe either in purſuite of good, or auoidance of euill, and they are all benefits of God, and helpes of nature, ſo long as they are kept vnder vertues correction.</p>
                  <p>But as too much of the beſt is euill, and exceſſe in vertue, vice; ſo paſsions let looſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limits, are imperfections, nothing being good that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth meaſure. And as the ſea is vnfit for trafficke, not onely when the windes are too boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, but alſo when they are too ſtill, and a middle gale and motion of the waues ſerueth
<pb facs="tcp:18234:112"/> beſt the ſaylers purpoſe; So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too ſtormy nor too calme a mind giueth Vertue the firſt courſe, but a middle temper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them both, in which the welordered paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are wrought to proſecute, not ſuffered to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert any vertuous endeuour. Such were the paſsions of this holy Saint, which were not guides to reaſon, but atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants vpon it, and commanded by ſuch a loue as could neuer exceede, becauſe the thing lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued was of infinite perfection. And if her weakneſſe of faith, (an infirmitie then common to all Chriſts diſciples) did ſuffer her vnderſtanding to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, yet was her will ſo ſetled in a moſt ſincere and perfect loue, that it led all her paſsions with the ſame byas, recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the want of beliefe, with
<pb facs="tcp:18234:112"/> the ſtrange effects of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent charitie. This loue and theſe paſsions are the ſubiect of this diſcourſe, which though it reach not to the dignitie of <hi>Maries</hi> deſerts, yet ſhall I think my indeuours well appayd, if it may but woo ſome skilfuller pennes from vnworthy labors, either to ſupply in this matter my want of ability, or in other of like pietie, (whereof the Scripture is full) to exerciſe their happier talents. I know that none can expreſſe a paſſion that he feeleth not, neither doth the penne deliuer but what it copieth out of the minde. And therefore the fineſt wits are now giuen to write paſſionate diſcourſes, I would wiſh them to make choiſe of ſuch paſſions, as it neither ſhould be ſhame to vtter, nor ſinne to feele.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18234:113"/>
                  <p>But whether my wiſhes in this behalfe take effect or not, I reape at the leaſt this reward of my paines, that I haue ſhewed my deſire to anſwer your cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, and ſet forth the due praiſes of this glorious Saint:</p>

But it is a iuſt complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the better ſort of perſons, that the fineſt wits loſe themſelues in the vaineſt follies, ſpilling much Art in ſome idle fancie, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their workes as witneſſes how long they haue beene in trauaile, to be in fine deliuered of a fable. And ſure it is a thing greatly to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that men of ſo high conceit,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:114"/> ſhould ſo much abaſe their habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that when they haue racked them to the vttermoſt endeuour, all the praiſe that they reape of their employment, conſiſteth in this, that they haue wiſely told a fooliſh tale, and carried a long lye very ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the end. Yet this inconuenience might find ſome excuſe, if the drift of their diſcourſe leuelled at any vertuous marke. For infables are often figured morall truths, and that couertly vttered to a common good, which without a maske would not find ſo free a paſſage. But when the ſubſtance of the worke hath neither truth nor probability; nor the purport thereof tendeth to any honeſt end, the writer is rather to be pitied than praiſed, and his bookes fitter for the fire than for the preſſe. This common ouerſight more haue obſerued, than endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſalue, euery one being able to reprooue, none willing to redreſſe ſuch faults, authoriſed eſpecially by generall cuſtome. And though if
<pb facs="tcp:18234:114"/> neceſſitie (the lawleſſe patron of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced actions) had not more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed than choiſe, this worke of ſo different a ſubiect from the vſuall vaine, ſhould haue bene no eye-ſore to thoſe that are pleaſed with worſe matters. Yet ſith the copies thereof flew fo faſt, and ſo falſe abroad, that it was in danger to come corrupted to the print, it ſeemed a leſſe euill to let it fly to common view in the natiue plume, and with the owne wings, than diſguiſed in a coat of a baſtard feather, or caſt off from the faſt of ſuch a corrector, as might hapily haue periſhed the ſound, and imped in ſome ſicke and ſory fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his owne fanſies.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt other mourneful acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, that loue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth it ſelfe vnto my memory, with which the bleſſed <hi>Marie Magdalene</hi> louing our Lord more than her ſelfe, followed him in his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to his death, attending vpon him when his diſciples fled and being more willing to dye with him, than they to liue without him. But not finding the fauour to accompany him in death, and loathing after him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in life, the fire of her true
<pb facs="tcp:18234:116"/> affection enflamed her heart, and her enflamed heart reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into vnceſſant teares, ſo that burning and bathing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene loue and griefe, ſhe led a life euer dying and felt a death neuer ending. And when he by whom ſhe liued was dead, and ſhe for whom he dyed enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedly left aliue, ſhe praiſed the dead more than the liuing: and hauing loſt that light of her life, ſhe deſired to dwell in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; in the ſhadow of death, chooſing Chriſts Tombe for her beſt home, and his coarſe for her chiefe comfort. For <hi>Mary</hi> (as the Euangeliſt ſaith) <hi>Stood without at the Tombe weeping.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But alas how vnfortunate is this woman, to whom neither life will affoord a deſired fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, nor death allow any wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed welcome? She hath abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the liuing, and choſen the company of the dead; and now it ſeemeth that euen the dead
<pb facs="tcp:18234:116"/> haue forſaken her, ſith the coarſe ſhe ſeeketh is taken away from her. And this was the cauſe that loue induced her to ſtand, and ſorrow enforced her to weepe. Her eye was watchfull to ſeeke whom her heart moſt longed to enioy, and her foot in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to runne, if her eye ſhould chance to eſpy him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſtandeth to be ſtill ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, preſt to watch euery way, and prepared to go whither any hope ſhould call her. But ſhe wept becauſe ſhe had ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſtanding: and that which moued her to watch, was the motiue of her teares. For as ſhe watched to finde whom ſhe had loſt, ſo ſhe wept for hauing loſt whom ſhe loued, her poore eyes being troubled at once with two contrarie offices, both to be cleare in ſight the better to ſeeke him, and yet cloudy with teares for miſſing the ſight of him.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18234:117"/>
                  <p>Yet was not this the entrance but the increaſe of her griefe, not the beginning, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of her moane. For firſt ſhe mourned for the departing of his ſoule out of his body, and now ſhe lamented the taking of his body out of the graue, being puniſhed with two wreckes of her onely welfare, both full of miſerie, but the laſt without all comfort. The firſt originall of her ſorrow grew, becauſe ſhe could not enioy him aliue: yet this ſorrow had ſome ſolace, for that ſhe hoped to haue enioyed him dead.</p>
                  <p>But when ſhe conſidered that his life was already loſt, and now not ſo much as his body could be found ſhe was wholly daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with diſmay, ſith this vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe admitted no helpe. She doubted leſt the loue of her maiſter (the onely portion that her fortune had left her) would ſoone languiſh in her cold
<pb facs="tcp:18234:117"/> breaſt, if it neither had his words to kindle it, nor his preſence to cheriſh it, nor ſo much as his dead aſhes to rake it vp. She had prepared her ſpices, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her oyntments, to pay him the laſt tribute of externall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And though <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> had already beſtowed an hundreth pounds of Mirrhe and Aloes, which was in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity ſufficient, in quality of the beſt, and as well applyed as art and deuotion could deuiſe: yet ſuch was her loue, that ſhe would haue thought any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie too little, except hers had bene added; the beſt in qualitie too meane, except hers were with it; and no diligence in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it enough, except her ſeruice were in it. Not that ſhe was ſharpe in cenſuring that which others had done, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe loue made her ſo deſirous to do all her ſelfe, that though all had bene done that ſhe could
<pb facs="tcp:18234:118"/> deuiſe, and as well as ſhe could wiſh, yet vnleſſe ſhe were an actor it would not ſuffice, ſith loue is as eager to be vttered in effects, as it is zealous in true affection. She came therefore now meaning to enbalme his corps, as ſhe had before annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his feet, and to preſerue the reliques of his body, as the onely remnant of all her bliſſe. And as in the ſpring of her felicitie ſhe had waſhed his feet with her teares, bewayling vnto him the death of her owne ſoule: ſo now ſhe came in the depth of her miſerie, to ſhed them afreſh for the death of his body. But when ſhe ſaw the graue open, and the bodie taken out, the labour of enbalming was preuented, but the cauſe of her weeping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and he that was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to her obſequies, was not wanting to her teares; and though ſhe found not whom to annoynt, yet found ſhe whom
<pb facs="tcp:18234:118"/> to lament.</p>
                  <p>And not without cauſe did <hi>Marie</hi> complaine, finding her firſt anguiſh doubled with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond griefe, and being ſurchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with two moſt violent ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes in one afflicted heart. For hauing ſetled her whole affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon Chriſt, and ſummed all her deſires and wiſhes into the loue of his goodneſſe, as nothing could equall his worthes: ſo was there not in the whole world, either a greater benefit for her to enioy than himſelfe, or any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dammage poſſible than his loſſe.</p>
                  <p>The murdering in his owne death, the life of all liues, left a generall death in all liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and his deceaſe not onely diſrobed our nature of her moſt royall ornaments, but impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed the world of all higheſt perfections. What maruell therefore though her vehement loue to ſo louely a Lord, being
<pb facs="tcp:18234:119"/> after the wrecke of his life, now alſo depriued of his dead body, feele as bitter pangs for his loſſe, as before it taſted ioyes in his preſence, and open as large an iſſue to teares of ſorrow, as euer heretofore to teares of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And though teares were rather oyle than water to her flame, apter to nouriſh than di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh her griefe: yet now being plonged in the depth of paine, ſhe yeelded her ſelfe captiue to all diſcomfort, carrying an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne mind in a more enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled body, and ſtill buſie in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing, but euer doubtfull in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining what ſhe might beſt do. For what could a ſilly woman do but weepe, that floating in a ſea of cares, found neither eare to heare her, nor tongue to direct her, nor hand to helpe her, nor heart to pittie her in her deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late caſe? True it is, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> came with her to the Tombe, and to make triall of
<pb facs="tcp:18234:119"/> her report were both within it: but as they were ſpeedy in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and diligent in ſearching, ſo were they as quicke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and fearefull of farther ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. And alas, what gained ſhe by their comming, but two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of her loſſe, two diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of her hope, and two pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of a new deſpaire? Loue moued them to come, but their loue was ſoone conquered, with ſuch feare, that it ſuffered them not to ſtay. But <hi>Mary,</hi> hoping in deſpaire, and perſeuering in hope, ſtood without feare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe now thought nothing left that ought to be feared. For ſhe hath loſt her maiſter, to whom ſhe was ſo entirely deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he was the totall of her loues, the height of her hopes, and the vttermoſt of her feares, and therefore beſides him, ſhe could neither loue other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hope for other comfort, nor feare other loſſe. The worſt ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:18234:120"/> could feare, was the death of her body, and that ſhee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſired than feared, ſith ſhee had alreadie loſt the life of her ſoule, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which anie other life would be a death, and with which any other death would haue bene a delight. But now ſhe thought it better to dye than to liue, becauſe ſhe might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily dying find, whom not dying ſhe looked not to enioy, and not enioying ſhe had little will to liue. For now ſhe loued nothing in her life, but her loue to Chriſt: and if any thing did make her willing to liue, it was onely the vnwillingneſſe that his Image ſhould dye with her, whoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe loue had limited in her heart, and treaſured vp in her ſweeteſt memories. And had ſhe not feared to breake the table, and to breake open the cloſet, to which ſhe had entruſted this laſt relique of her loſt happineſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:120"/> the violence of griefe, would haue melted her heart into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleeding teares, and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her remembrance with a fatall obliuion. And yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, ſhe is now in ſo imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a ſort aliue, that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued true in her, that <hi>Loue is as ſtrong as death.</hi> For what could death haue done more in <hi>Mary</hi> than loue did? Her wits were aſtonied, and all her ſenſes ſo amazed, that in the end finding ſhe did not know, ſeeing ſhe could not diſcerne, hearing ſhe perceiued not, and more than all this, ſhe was not there where ſhe was, for ſhe was wholly where her maiſter was; more where ſhe loued than where ſhe liued, and leſſe in her ſelfe than in his body, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, where it was ſhe could not imagine. For ſhe ſought, &amp; as yet ſhe found not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtood at the Tombe wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for it, being now altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:18234:121"/> giuen to mourning, and driuen to miſery.</p>
                  <p>But ô <hi>Mary,</hi> by whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, vpon what hope, or with what heart, couldeſt thou ſtand alone, when the Diſciples were departed? Thou wert there once before they came, thou turnedſt againe at their comming, and yet thou ſtayeſt when they are gone. Alas that thy Lord is not in the Tombe, thine owne eyes haue often ſeene, the Diſciples hands haue felt, the empty Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don doth auouch, and cannot all this winne thee to beleeue it? No no, thou wouldeſt rather condemne thine owne eyes of errour, and both their eyes and hands of deceit, yea, rather ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all teſtimonies for vntrue, than not looke whom thou haſt loſt, euen there, where by no diligence he could be found. When thou thinkeſt of other places, and canſt not imagine any ſo likely as this, thou ſeekeſt
<pb facs="tcp:18234:121"/> againe in this, and though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo often ſought, it muſt be an haunt for hope. For when things dearely affected are loſt, loues natures is, neuer to be weary of ſearching euen the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſt ſearched corners, being more willing to thinke that all the ſenſes are miſtaken, than to yeeld that hope ſhould quaile. Yet now ſith it is ſo euident, that he is taken away, what ſhould moue thee to remaine here where the perill is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and no profit likely? Can the wit of one (and ſhe a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) wholly poſſeſſed with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, haue more light to diſcerne danger, than two wits of two men, and both principall fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the parent of all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Or if (notwithſtanding the danger) there had bene iuſt cauſe to encounter it, were not two together, being both to Chriſt ſworne champions, each to other affected friends,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:122"/> and to all his enemies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed foes, more likely to haue preuailed, than one fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine heart, timorous by kind, and already amazed with this dreadfull accident?</p>
                  <p>But alas, why do I vrge her with reaſon, whoſe reaſon is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into loue, &amp; that iudgeth it folly to follow ſuch reaſon, as ſhould any way impaire her loue? Her thoughts were arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by euery thread of Chriſts Sindon, and ſhe was captiue to ſo many priſons, as the tombe had memories of her loſt maſter: Loue being her Iaylor in them all, and nothing able to ranſome her, but the recouery of her Lord. What maruaile then though the Apoſtles examples drew her not away, whom ſo violent a loue enforced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, which preſcribing lawes both to wit and will, is guided by no other law but it ſelfe? She could not thinke of any feare,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:122"/> nor ſtand in feare of any force. Loue armed her againſt all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and being already woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded wtih the greateſt griefe, ſhe had no leiſure to remember any leſſer euill. Yea ſhe had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all things, and her ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all things, onely mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of him whom ſhe loued aboue all things. And yet her loue, by reaſon of her loſſe, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both her mind and memory ſo deepe in ſorrow, and ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied her wits in the conceit of his abſence, that all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his former promiſes, was diuerted with the throng of preſent diſcomforts, and ſhe ſeemed to haue forgotten alſo him beſides whom ſhe remembred nothing. For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe had ſhe remembred him as ſhee ſhould, ſhee would not haue now thought the tombe a fit place to ſeeke him, neither would ſhe mourne for him as dead, and remoued<pb facs="tcp:18234:123"/> by others force, but ioy in him as reuiued, and riſen by his own power. For he had often fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told both the manner of his death, and the day of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. But alas, let her heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe excuſe her, and the vnwon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe of the miracle pleade her pardon, ſith dread &amp; amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath dulled her ſenſes, diſtempered her thoughts, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged her hopes, awaked her paſſions, and left her no other liberty but onely to weepe. She wept therefore, being onely able to weepe. <hi>And as ſhe was weeping, ſhe ſtouped downe and looked into the Monument, and ſhe ſaw two Angels in white, ſitting one at the head, and another at the feet, where the body of Ieſus had bene layd. They ſaid vnto her, Woman why weepeſt thou?</hi> Iohn 20.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Mary,</hi> thy good hap excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thy hope, and where thy laſt ſorrow was bred, thy firſt ſuccour ſpringeth. Thou diddeſt
<pb facs="tcp:18234:123"/> ſeeke but one, and thou haſt found two. A dead body was thy errand, and thou haſt light vpon two aliue. Thy weeping was for a man, and thy teares haue obtained Angels. Suppreſſe now thy ſadneſſe, and refreſh thy heart with this good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Theſe Angels inuite thee to a parley, they ſeeme to take pitty of thy caſe, and it may be, they haue ſome happy tidings to tell thee. Thou haſt hitherto ſought in vaine, as one either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene, or vnknowne, or at the leaſt vnregarded, ſith the party thou ſeekeſt, neither tendereth thy teares, nor anſwereth thy cryes, nor relenteth with thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentings. Either he doth not heare, or he will not helpe: he hath paraduenture left to loue thee, and is loth to yeeld thee reliefe, and therefore take ſuch comfort as thou findeſt, ſith thou art not ſo lucky, as to finde that which thou couldeſt wiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb facs="tcp:18234:124"/> what they are, where they ſit, from whence they come, and to whom they ſpeake. They are Angels of peace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent without cauſe, nor ſeene but of fauour. They ſit in the tombe, to ſhew that they are no ſtrangers to thy loſſe. They come from heauen, from whence all happy news deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. They ſpeake to thy ſelfe, as though they had ſome ſpeciall embaſſage to deliuer vnto thee. Aske them therefore of thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, for they are likelieſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thee a deſired anſwer. Thou kneweſt him too well, to thinke that hell hath deuoured him: thou haſt long ſought, and haſt not found him on earth, and what place ſo fit for him as to be in heauen? Aske therefore of thoſe Angels that came newly from thence, and it may be, their report will highly pleaſe thee. Or if thou art reſolued to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thy ſeeking, who can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:18234:124"/> helpe thee, than they that are as ſwift as thy thought, as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as thine owne heart, and as louing to thy Lord as thou thy felfe? Take therefore thy good hap, leſt it be taken away from thee, and content thee with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſith thy maſter hath giuen thee ouer.</p>
                  <p>But alas, what meaneth this change, and how happeneth this ſtrange alteration? The time hath bene that fewer teares would haue wrought greater effect, ſhorter ſeeking haue ſooner found, and leſſe paine haue procured more pittie. The time hath bene that thy annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his feet, was accepted and prayſed, thy waſhing them with teares highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, &amp; thy wiping the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with thy haire, moſt curteouſly conſtrued. How then doth it now fall out, that hauing brought thy ſweet oyles to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint his whole body, hauing ſhed as many teares, as would
<pb facs="tcp:18234:125"/> haue waſhed more than his feet, and hauing not onely thy haire, but thy heart ready to ſerue him, he is not moued with all theſe duties, ſo much as once to afford thee his fight? Is it not he that reclaimed thee from thy wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring courſes, that diſpoſſeſſed thee of thy damned Inhabitants; and from the wilds of ſinne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered thee into the fold and family of his flock? Was not thy houſe his home, his loue thy life, thy ſelfe his diſciple? Did not he defend thee againſt the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, pleade for thee againſt <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and excuſe thee to thy ſiſter? In ſumme, was not he thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron and Protector in all thy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities?</p>
                  <p>O good <hi>Ieſu,</hi> what hath thus eſtranged thee from her? Thou haſt heretofore ſo pitied her teares, that ſeeing them, thou couldeſt not refraine thine. In one of her greateſt agonies, for loue of her that ſo much loued
<pb facs="tcp:18234:125"/> thee, thou didſt recall her dead brother to life, turning her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint into vnexpected content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And we know that thou doeſt not vſe to alter courſe without cauſe, nor to chaſtiſe without deſert. Thou art the firſt that inuiteſt, and the laſt that forſakeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neuer leauing but firſt left; and euer offering, till thou art refuſed. How then hath ſhe forfeited thy fauour? or with what treſpaſſe hath ſhe earned thy ill will? That ſhe neuer left to loue thee, her heart will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, her hand will ſubſcribe, her tongue will proteſt, her teares will teſtifie, and her ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king doth aſſure. And alas, is her particular caſe ſo farre from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that thou ſhouldeſt rather alter thy nature, than ſhe better her Fortune, and be to her as thou art to no other? For our parts ſince thy laſt ſhew of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards her, we haue found no other fault in her, but that ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:18234:126"/> was the earlieſt vp to ſeeke thee, readieſt to annoint thee, and when ſhe ſaw that thou wert re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, ſhe forthwith did weepe for thee, and preſently went for helpe to finde thee. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thoſe two that ſhe brought, being leſſe carefull of thee than fearefull of themſelues, when they had ſeene what ſhe had ſaid, ſodainely ſhrunke away, behold ſhe ſtill ſtayeth, ſhe ſtill ſeeketh, ſhe ſtill weepeth. If this be a fault, we cannot deny but this ſhe doth, and to this ſhe perſwadeth; yea, this ſhe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaneth to amend, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſteth thee to forgiue: if ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou reckoneſt this as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable, puniſhed ſhe muſt be, ſith no excuſe hath effect where the fact pleadeth guiltie. But if this import not any offence but a true affection, and be rather a good deſire than an euill deſert, why art thou ſo hard a Iudge to ſo ſoft a creature, requiting her
<pb facs="tcp:18234:126"/> loue with thy loſſe, and ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her hopes in this vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Are not thoſe thy words; <hi>I loue thoſe that loue me, and who watcheth early for me ſhall find me?</hi> why then doth not this woman find thee, that was vp ſo early to watch for thee? Why doeſt thou not with like repay her, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth vpon thee her whole loue, ſith thy word is her war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and thy promiſe her due debt? Art thou leſſe moued with theſe teares that ſhe ſheddeth for thee her onely Maſter, than thou wert with thoſe that ſhe ſhed before thee for her deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed brother? Or doth her loue to thy ſeruant more pleaſe thee than her loue to thy ſelfe? Our loue to others muſt not be to them, but to thee in them. For he loueth thee ſo much the leſſe, that loue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h any thing with thee. If therefore ſhe then deſerued well for louing thee in another, ſhe deſerued better now, for

Of thy ſelfe thou haſt ſaid, that thou art <hi>The way, the truth, and the life.</hi> If then thou art a way eaſie to find and neuer erring, how doth ſhe miſſe thee? If a life giuing life and neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, why is ſhe ready to dye for thee? If a true promiſing truth and neuer failing, how is ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued of thee? For if what thy tongue did ſpeake, thy truth will auerre, ſhe will neuer aske more to make her moſt happy.

                     </gap> is out of queſtion, ſith ſhe made choiſe of nothing but only of thee But how can it be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that this part ſhal not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her, ſith thou that art this part art already taken away? If ſhe could haue kept thee, ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:18234:127"/> would not haue loſt thee: and had it bene in her power, as it was in her will, ſhe would neuer haue parted from thee: and might ſhe now be reſtored to thy preſence, ſhe would trie all fortunes rather than for go thee. Sith therefore ſhe ſeeketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what ſhe choſe, and the loſſe of her choiſe is the only cauſe of her combat, either vouchſafe thou to keep this beſt part that ſhe choſe in her, or I ſee not how it can be true, that it ſhall not be taken from her. But thy meaning haply was, that though it be taken from her eyes, yet it ſhould neuer be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her heart; &amp; it may be thy inward preſence ſupplyeth thine outward abſence: yet I can hardly thinke, but that if <hi>Mary</hi> had thee within her, ſhe could feele it, and if ſhe felt it, ſhe would neuer ſeeke thee. Thou art too hot a fire to be in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and not to burne her, and
<pb facs="tcp:18234:128"/> thy light is too great, to leaue her mind in this darkneſſe if it ſhined in her. In true louers eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part is an eye, and euery thought a looke, and therefore ſo ſweet an obiect among ſo many eyes, and in ſo great a light, could neuer lye ſo hidden but loue would eſpy it. No, no, if <hi>Mary</hi> had thee, her innocent heart (neuer taught to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) could not make complaint the out-ſide of a concealed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, neither would ſhe turne her thoughts to paſture in a dead mans Tombe, if at home ſhe might bid them to ſo heauenly a banquet. Her loue would not haue a thought to ſpare, nor a minute to ſpend in any other action, than in enioying of thee, whom ſhe knew too well, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge the leaſt part of her from ſo high an happineſſe. For her thirſt of thy preſence was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and the ſea of thy ioyes ſo well able to afford her a full
<pb facs="tcp:18234:128"/> draught, that though euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in her ſhould take in a whole tide of thy delights, ſhe would thinke them too few to quiet her deſires. Yea doubtleſſe, if ſhe had thee within her, ſhe would not enuie the fortune of the richeſt Empreſſe, yea ſhe would more reioyce to be thy Tombe in earth, than a throne in heauen, and diſdaine to be a Saint if ſhe were worthy to be but thy ſhrine.</p>
                  <p>But paraduenture it is now with her mind, as it was with the Apoſtles eyes; and as they ſeeing thee walke vpon the Sea took thee for a Ghoſt, ſo ſhe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee in her hart, deemeth thee but a fancy, being yet better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thy bodily ſhape than with thy ſpirituall power.</p>
                  <p>But ô <hi>Mary,</hi> it ſeemeth too ſtrange, that he whom thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt, and for whom thou wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, ſhould thus giue thee ouer to theſe painefull fits, if in thee
<pb facs="tcp:18234:129"/> he did not ſee a cauſe for which he will not be ſeene of thee. Still thy plaint, and ſtint thy weeping, for I doubt there is ſome treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe in thy teares, &amp; ſome ſinne in thy ſorrow. Doeſt thou not remember his words to thee and to other women, when he ſaid: <hi>Daughters of Ieruſalem weepe not for me, but weepe for your ſelues and for your children?</hi> What mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thou then to continue this courſe? Doth he ſorbid thy teares, and wilt thou not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare them? Is it no fault to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe his will, or is not that his will that his words do import? The fault muſt be mended, ere the penance be releaſed, and therefore either ceaſſe to weepe, or neuer hope to finde. But I know this Logicke little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thee, and I might as ſoone win thee to forbeare liuing as to leaue weeping.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt ſay, that though he forbad thee to weepe for him,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:129"/> yet he left thee free, to weepe for thy ſelfe, and ſith thy loue hath made thee one with him, thou weepeſt but for thy ſelfe when thou weepeſt for him. But I anſwer thee againe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is one with thee, and thy weeping for him hath bene forbidden thee, thou canſt not weepe for thy ſelfe, but his words wil condemne thee. For if thou &amp; he are one, for which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou weepeſt it is all one, &amp; therefore ſith for him thou maiſt not weepe, forbeare all weeping left it ſhould offend. Yea but (ſaiſt thou) to barre me from weeping, is to abridge me of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and reſtraint of liberty is a penaltie; and euery penaltie ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſome offence: but an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence it is not to weepe for my ſelfe, for he would neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande it, if it were not lawfull to do it. The fault therefore muſt be; in being one with him, that maketh the weeping for my
<pb facs="tcp:18234:130"/> ſelfe, a weeping alſo for him. And if this be a fault, I will neuer amend it; and let them that thinke it ſo, do penance for it: for my part, ſith I haue loſt my mirth, I will make much of my ſorrow, and ſith I haue no ioy but in teares, I may lawfully ſhed them. Neither thinke I his former word, a warrant againſt his latter deed. And what need had he to weepe vpon the Croſſe, but for our example, which if it were good for him to giue, it cannot be euill for me to follow? No, no, it is not my weeping that cauſeth my loſſe, ſith a world of eyes, and a ſea of teares, could not worthily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the miſſe of ſuch a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                  <p>Yet, ſince neither thy ſeeking findeth, nor thy weeping pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth, ſatisfie thy ſelfe with the ſight of Angels. Demaund the cauſe of their comming, and the reaſon of thy Lords remoue,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:130"/> and ſith they firſt offer thee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of parley, be not thou too dainty of thy diſcourſe. It may be they can calme thy ſtormes, and quiet thy vnreſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conceale not from them thy ſore, leſt thou loſe the benefit of their emplaiſter. But nothing can moue <hi>Mary</hi> to admit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or entertaine any company: for to one alone, and for euer ſhe hath vowed her ſelfe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be to him, ſhe will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lend her eare long to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor borrow others helpe, leſt by the ſeeking to allay her ſmart, ſhe ſhould leſſen her loue. But drawing into her mind all penſiue conceits, ſhe muſeth and pineth in a conſuming languor, taking comfort in nothing but in being comfortleſſe.</p>
                  <p>Alas, (ſaith ſhe) ſmall is the light that a ſtarre can yeeld when the Sunne is downe, and a ſorry exchange to go gather the crums after the loſſe of an
<pb facs="tcp:18234:131"/> heauenly repaſt. My eyes are not vſed to ſee by the glimſe of a ſparke: and in ſeeking the Sunne it is either needleſſe or bootleſſe to borrow the light of a candle, ſith either it muſt bewray it ſelfe with the ſelfe light, or no other light can euer diſcouer it. If they come to disburden me of my heauineſſe, their comming will be burdenſome vnto me, and they will load me more while they labour my reliefe. They cannot perſwade me, that my maiſter is not loſt, for my owne eyes will diſproue them. They can leſſe tell me where he may be found, for they would not be ſo ſimple to be ſo long from him: or if they can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare him, ſurely they do not know him, whom none can truly know, and liue long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. All their demurres would be tedious, and diſcourſes irkſome. Impaire my loue they might, but appay it they could
<pb facs="tcp:18234:131"/> not, to which he that firſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the debt is the onely pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They either want power, will, or leaue to tell me my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or at the firſt word they would haue done it, ſith Angels are not vſed to idle ſpeeches, and to me all talke is idle that doth not tell me of my maiſter. They know not where he is, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are come to the place where he laſt was, making the Tombe their heauen, and the remembrance of his preſence the food of their felicitie. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they could tell me, if they told me not of him, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they could tell me of him, if they told me not where he were, both their telling and my hearing were but a waſting of time. I neither came to ſee them, nor deſire to heare them. I came not to ſee Angels, but him that made both me and Angels, and to whom I owe more than both to men and
<pb facs="tcp:18234:132"/> Angels.</p>
                  <p>And to thee I appeale, ô moſt louing Lord, whether my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted heart doth not truly defray the tribute of an vndeuided loue. To thee I appeale, whether I haue ioyned any partner with thee, in the ſmall poſſeſſion of my poore ſelfe. And I would to God I were as, priuie where thy body is, as thou art, who is onely Lord and owner of my ſoule.</p>
                  <p>But alas ſweet <hi>Ieſu,</hi> where thou wert thou art not, &amp; where thou art I know not: wretched is the caſe that I am in, and yet how to better it I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Alas ô my onely deſire, why haſt thou left me wauering in theſe vncertainties, and in how wild a maze wander my doubtful &amp; perplexed thoughts? If I ſtay here where he is not, I ſhall neuer finde him. If I go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſeeke, I know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To leaue the Tombe is a death, and to ſtand helpleſſe by
<pb facs="tcp:18234:132"/> it an vncurable diſeaſe, ſo that all my comfort is now conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this, that I am free to chuſe whether I will ſtay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out helpe, or go without hope, that is in effect, with what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I will end my life. And yet euen this were too happy a choiſe for ſo vnhappy a creature. If I might be chuſer of mine owne death, ô how quickly ſhould that choiſe be made, and how willingly would I runne to that execution? I would be nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the ſame croſſe, with the ſame nailes, &amp; in the ſame place: my heart ſhould be wounded with his ſpeare, my head with his thornes, my body with his whippes: Finally, I would taſte all his torments, and tread all his embrued and bloudie ſteps.</p>
                  <p>But ô ambitious thoughts, why gaze you vpon ſo high a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie? why thinke you of ſo glorious a death, that are priuie to ſo infamous a life? Death alas
<pb facs="tcp:18234:133"/> I deſerue, yea not one but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite deaths. But ſo ſweete a death, ſeaſoned with ſo many comforts, the very inſtruments whereof were able to raiſe the deadeſt corps, and depure the moſt defiled ſoule, were too ſmall a ſcourge for my great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. And therefore I am left to feele ſo many deaths as I liue houres, and to paſſe as many pangs as I haue thoughts of my loſſe, which are as many as there are minutes, and as violent as if they were all in euery one. But ſith I can neither die as he died, nor liue where he lyeth dead, I I will liue out my liuing death by his graue, and dye on my dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life by his ſweete Tombe. Better is it after loſſe of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to looke to his Sepulcher, than after the loſſe of the one, to leaue the other to be deſtroyed. No, no, though I haue bene rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of the Saint, I will at the leaſt haue care of the ſhrine,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:133"/> which though it be ſpoiled of the moſt ſoueraigne hoaſt, yet ſhall it be the Altar where I will daily ſacrifice my heart, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp my teares.</p>
                  <p>Here will I euer leade, yea here do I meane to end my wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched life, that I may at the leaſt be buried by the Tombe of my Lord, and take my iron ſleepe neare this couch of ſtone which his preſence hath made the place of ſweeteſt repoſe.</p>
                  <p>It may be alſo that this empty Syndon lyeth here to no vſe, and this Tombe being open without any in it, may giue occaſion to ſome mercifull heart, that ſhall firſt light vpon my vnburied bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to wrap me in his ſhroud, and to interre me in this Tombe.</p>
                  <p>O too fortunate lot, for ſo vnfortunate a woman to craue: no: no: I do not craue it. For alas, I dare not, yet if ſuch an ouer-ſight ſhould be committed, I do now before-hand, forgiue that
<pb facs="tcp:18234:134"/> ſinner, and were it no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to wiſh it aliue, than to ſuffer it dead, if I knew the party that ſhould firſt paſſe by me, I would woo him with my teares, and hire him with my prayers, to bleſſe me with this felicity. And though I dare not wiſh any to do it, yet this (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence) I may ſay to all, that I loue this <hi>Syndon</hi> aboue all clothes in the world, and this Tombe I eſteeme more than any Princes monument: yea, and I thinke that coarſe highly fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſhall ſucceed my Lord in it: and for my part, as I meane that the ground where I ſtand ſhall be my death-bed; ſo am I not of <hi>Iacobs</hi> mind, to haue my body buried farre from the place where it dyeth, but euen in the next and readieſt graue, and that as ſoone as my breath faileth, ſith delayes are bootleſſe where death hath won poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18234:134"/>
                  <p>But alas, I dare not ſay any more, let my body take ſuch fortune as befalleth it: my ſoule at the leaſt ſhall dwell in this ſweet Paradiſe, and from this brittle caſe of fleſh and bloud, paſſe preſently into the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tombe of God and man. It is now enwrapped in a maſſe of corruption, it ſhall then enioy a place of high perfection: where it is now it is more by force than by choiſe, and like a repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning priſoner in a loathed gaile: but there in a little roome it ſhould find perfect reſt, and in the priſon of death, the liberty of a ioyfull life.</p>
                  <p>O ſweet Tombe of my ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Lord, while I liue I will ſtay by thee, when I die, I will cleaue vnto thee: neither aliue nor dead, will I euer be drawne from thee. Thou art the Altar of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, the temple of truth, the ſanctuary of ſafe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie, the graue of death, and the cradle of eternall
<pb facs="tcp:18234:135"/> life. O heauen of my eclipſed Sunne, receiue vnto thee this ſilly ſtarre that hath now alſo loſt all wiſhed light. O Whale that haſt ſwallowed my onely <hi>Ionas,</hi> ſwallow alſo me, more worthy to be thy prey, ſith I, and not he, was the cauſe of this bloudie tempeſt. O Ceſterne of my innocent <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> take me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy drie bottome, ſith I, and not he gaue iuſt cauſe of offence to my enraged brethren. But alas, in what cloud haſt thou hidden the light of our way? Vpon what ſhore haſt thou caſt vp the Preacher of all truth? or to what Iſmaelite haſt thou yeelded the purueiour of our life?</p>
                  <p>Oh vnhappy me, why did I not before thinke of that which I now aske? Why did I leaue him when I had him, thus to lament him now that I haue loſt him? If I had watched with perſeuerance, either none would haue taken
<pb facs="tcp:18234:135"/> him, or they ſhould haue taken me with him.</p>
                  <p>But through too much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſſe in keeping the Law, I haue loſt the Law-maker; and by being too ſcrupulous in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing his ceremonies, I am proued irreligious in loſing him ſelfe, ſith I ſhould rather haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with the truth, than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken it to ſolemnize the figure. The Sabboth could not haue bene prophaned in ſtanding by his coarſe, by which the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned things are ſanctified, and whoſe touch doth not defile the cleane, but cleanſeth the moſt defiled.</p>
                  <p>But when it was time to ſtay, I departed: when it was too late to helpe, I returned: and now I repent my folly, when it cannot be amended. But let my heart diſſolue into ſighes, mine eyes melt in teares, and my deſolate ſoule languiſh in diſlikes: yea, let all that I am and haue, endure
<pb facs="tcp:18234:136"/> the deſerued puniſhment, that if he were incenſed with my fault, he may be appeaſed with my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and returne vpon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment that fled from the offence.</p>
                  <p>Thus when her timorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience had indited her of ſo great an omiſſion, and her tongue enforced the euidence with theſe bitter accuſations, Loue, that was now the onely vmpire in all her cauſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned her eyes to a freſh ſhowre of teares, her breaſt to a new ſtorme of ſighes, and her ſoule, to be perpetuall priſoner to reſtleſſe ſorrowes.</p>
                  <p>But ô <hi>Mary,</hi> thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe in thy owne deſires, and it well appeareth, that exceſſe of griefe, hath bred in thee a defect of due prouidence. And woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou indeed haue thy wiſhes come to paſſe, and thy words fulfilled? Tell me then, I pray thee, if thy heart were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:136"/> where wouldeſt thou harbour thy Lord? what woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou offer him? how woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou loue him?</p>
                  <p>Thine eyes haue loſt him, thy hands cannot feele him, thy feet cannot follow him: and if it be at all in thee, it is thy heart that hath him, and wouldeſt thou now haue that diſſolued, from thence alſo to exile him? And if thine eyes were melted, thy ſoule in langour, and thy ſenſes decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how wouldeſt thou ſee him, if he did appeare? how ſhouldeſt thou heare him, if he did ſpeake? how couldeſt thou know him, though he were there preſent?</p>
                  <p>Thou thinkeſt haply that he loued thee ſo well, that if thy heart were ſpent for his loue, he would either lend his own heart vnto thee, or create a new heart in thee, better than that which thy ſorrow tooke from thee. It may be thou imagineſt that if thy ſoule would giue place, his
<pb facs="tcp:18234:137"/> ſoule wanting now a bodie, would enter into thine, with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of all thy ſenſes, and releaſe of thy ſorrowes.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Mary,</hi> thou diddeſt not marke what thy maiſter was wont to ſay, when he told thee, that the third day he ſhould riſe againe. For if thou hadſt heard him, or at the leaſt vnderſtood him, thou wouldeſt not thinke, but that he now vſed both his heart and ſoule in the life of his owne body. And therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to the Angels, and enquire more of them, leſt the Lord be diſpleaſed, that comming from him, thou wilt not entertaine them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe deuotions were all fixed vpon a nobler Saint, and that had ſo ſtraightly bound her thoughts to his only affection, that ſhe rather deſired to vnknow whom ſhe knew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, than to burthen her mind with the knowledge of new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:137"/> could not make her will, long ſince poſſeſſed with the higheſt loue, ſtoope to the acceptance of meaner friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. And for this, though ſhe did not ſcornefully reiect, yet did ſhe with humilitie refuſe the Angels company, thinking it no diſcourteſie to take her ſelfe from them, for to giue her ſelfe more wholly to her Lord, to whom both ſhe and they were wholly deuoted, &amp; ought moſt loue and greateſt duty. Sorrow alſo being now the onely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of all that ſenſe, deliuered to her vnderſtanding, made her conſter their demand in a more doubtfull than true meaning.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>(ſaith ſhe)</hi> they came to eaſe my affliction, they could not be ignorant of the cauſe: and if they were not ignorant of it, they would neuer aske it, why then did they ſay, <hi>Woman why weepeſt thou?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If their queſtion did import
<pb facs="tcp:18234:138"/> a prohibition, the neceſſitie of the occaſion doth countermand their counſaile, and fitter it were they ſhould weepe with me, than I in not weeping obey them. If the Sunne were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſhew his brightneſſe, when the father of lights was darkned with ſuch diſgrace: if the heauens diſcolouring their beauties, ſuted themſelues to their makers fortune: if the whole frame of nature were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſſolued to ſee the author of nature ſo vnhaturally abuſed: why may not Angels, that beſt knew the indignitie of the caſe, make vp a part in this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſort? And eſpecially now, that by the loſſe of his body, the cauſe of weeping is increaſed, and yet the number of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners leſſened: ſith the Apoſtles are fled, all his friends afraid, and poore I left alone to ſupply the teares of all creatures? <hi>O who will giue water to my head, and a
<pb facs="tcp:18234:138"/> fountaine of teares vnto mine eyes, that I may weepe day and night, and neuer ceaſſe weeping?</hi> O my onely Lord, thy griefe was the greateſt that euer was in man, and my griefe as great as euer happened to woman: for my loue hath carued me no ſmall portion of thine, thy loſſe hath redoubled the torment of my owne, and all creatures ſeeme to haue made ouer to me theirs, leauing me as the vicegerent of all their ſorrow. Sorrow with me at the leaſt ô thou Tombe, and thaw into teares you har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſtones. The time is now come, that you are licenſed to cry, and bound to recompence the ſilence of your Lords Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, of whom he himſelfe ſayd to the Phariſes, that if they held their peace, the very ſtones ſhould cry for them. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſith feare hath locked vp their lips, and ſadneſſe made them mute, let the ſtones cry out
<pb facs="tcp:18234:139"/> againſt the murd erers of my Lord, and bewray the robbers of his ſacred body. And I feare that were it well knowne who hath taken him away, there is no ſtone ſo ſtony, but ſhould haue cauſe to lament.</p>
                  <p>It was doubtleſſe the ſpite of ſome malicious Phariſee or bloudy Scribe, that not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thoſe torments that he ſuffered in life (of which euery one to any other would haue bene a tyrannicall death) hath now ſtolen away his dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to practiſe vpon it ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage cruelty, and to glut their pitileſſe eyes and brutiſh hearts with the vnnaturall vſage of his helpleſſe corps. O yee rocks and ſtones, if euer you muſt cry out, now it is high time, ſith the light, the life, and the Lord of the world is thus darkned, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred, and outragiouſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed.</p>
                  <p>Doth not his tongue, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:18234:139"/> truth is infallible, and whoſe word omnipotent, commanding both winds and ſeas, and neuer diſobeyed of the moſt ſenſible creatures, promiſe to arme the world, and make the whole earth to fight againſt the ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſons, in defence of the iuſt? And who more iuſt than the Lord of iuſtice? who more ſenſleſſe than his barbarous murtherers, whoſe inſatiable thirſt of his innocent bloud, could not be ſtaunched with their cruell butchering him at his death, vnleſſe they proceeded further in this helliſh impiety to his dead body. Why then do not all creatures ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe themſelues to reuenge ſo iuſt a quarrell, vpon ſo ſenſleſſe wretches, left of all reaſon, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of humanitie, and berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all feeling both of God and man?</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Mary,</hi> why doeſt thou thus torment thy ſelf with theſe
<pb facs="tcp:18234:140"/> tragicall ſurmiſes? Doeſt thou thinke that the Angels would ſit ſtill, if their maiſter were not well? Did they ſerue him after his faſting, and would they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him after his deceaſſe? Did they comfort him before he was apprehended, and would not defend him when he was dead? If in the garden he might haue had twelue. Legions of them, is his power ſo quite dead with his body, that he could not now command them? Was there an Angell found to helpe <hi>Daniel</hi> to his dinner, to ſaue <hi>Toby</hi> from the fiſh, yea and to defend <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> poore beaſt from his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters rage: and is the Lord of Angels of ſo little reckoning, that if his body ſtood in need, neuer an Angell would defend it? Thou ſeeſt two here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to honour his Tombe, and how much more carefull would they be to do homage to his perſon? Beleeue not <hi>Mary</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:18234:140"/> they would ſmile, if thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſuch occaſion to weepe. They would not ſo gloriouſly ſhine in white, if a blacke and mourning weede did better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, or were a fitter liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for thy maiſter to giue, or them to weare. Yeeld not more to thy vncertaine feare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued loue, than to their aſſured knowledge, and neuer erring charitie. Can a materiall eye ſee more than an heauenly ſpirit, or the glimmering of the twi-light giue better aime than the beams of their eternall Sunne? Would they (thinkeſt thou) waite vpon the winding ſheete, while the coarſe were abuſed, or be here for thy comfort, if their Lord did need their ſeruice? No, no, he was neither any theeues booty, nor Phariſees pray; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the Angels ſo careleſſe of him, as thy ſuſpition preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. And if their preſence and demeanour cannot alter thy
<pb facs="tcp:18234:141"/> conceit, looke vpon the clothes and they will teach thee thine errour, and cleare thee of thy doubt.</p>
                  <p>Would any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thiefe, thinkeſt thou, haue bene ſo religious, as to haue ſtolen the body, and left the clothes? yea, would he haue bene ſo venturous, as to haue ſtayed the vnſhrowding of the coarſe, the well ordering of the ſheets, and folding vp the nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins? Thou knoweſt that the Mirrhe maketh linnen cleaue as faſt as pitch or glue: and was a thiefe at ſo much leiſure, as to diſſolue the Myrrhe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath the dead? what did the watch while the ſcales were broken, the Tombe opened, the body vnfolded, all other things ordered as now thou ſeeſt? And if all this cannot yet perſwade thee, beleeue at the leaſt thy owne experience. When thy maiſter was ſtripped at the croſſe, thou knoweſt that his
<pb facs="tcp:18234:141"/> onely garment being congealed to his goarie backe, came not off without many parts of his skin, &amp; doubtleſſe would haue torne off many more, if he had bene annointed with Myrrhe: Looke then into the ſheete, whether there remaine any parcell of skin, or any one haire of his head: and ſith there is none to be found, beleeue ſome better iſſue of thy maiſters abſence than thy feare ſuggeſteth. A guiltie conſcience doubteth want of time, and therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcheth haſtily. It is in hazard to be diſcouered, and therefore practiſeth in darkneſſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie. It euer worketh in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame feare, and therefore hath no leiſure to place things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly. But to vnwrap ſo mangled a body, out of Mirrhed cloathes without tearing of any skinne, or leauing on any Mirrhe, is a thing either to man impoſſible, or not poſſible to be done with
<pb facs="tcp:18234:142"/> ſuch ſpeed, without light or helpe, and with ſo good order. Aſſure thy ſelfe therefore, that if either of malice, or by fraud the coarſe had bene remoued, the linnen and myrrhe ſhould neuer haue bene left; and neither could the Angels looke ſo chearefully, nor the clothes lye ſo orderly, but to import ſome happier ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident than thou conceiueſt. But to free thee more from feare, conſider theſe words of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Woman why weepeſt thou?</hi> For what do they ſignifie, but as much in effect as if they had ſaid: Where Angels reioyce, it agreeth not that a woman ſhold weepe, and where heauenly eyes are witneſſes of ioy, no mortall eye ſhould controll them with teſtimonies of ſorrow? With more than a manly courage thou diddeſt before my comming, arme thy feet to runne among ſwords, thy armes to remoue huge loades, thy body to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb facs="tcp:18234:142"/> all Tyrants rage, and thy ſoule to be ſundred with violent tortures: and art thou now ſo much a <hi>Woman</hi> that thou canſt not command thine eyes to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare teares? If thou wert a true Diſciple, ſo many proofes would perſwade thee, but now thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous humour maketh thee vnworthy of that ſtile, and we can affoord thee no better title, than a <hi>Woman,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ô <hi>Woman,</hi> and too much a <hi>Woman,</hi> why weepeſt thou?</p>
                  <p>If there were here any coarſe, we might thinke that ſorrow for the dead enforced thy teares: but now that thou findeſt it a place of the liuing, why doeſt thou here ſtand weeping for the dead?</p>
                  <p>Is our preſence ſo diſcomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that thou ſhouldeſt weepe to behold vs? or is it the courſe of thy kindneſſe with teares to entertaine vs? If they be teates of loue to teſtifie thy good will,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:143"/> as thy loue is acknowledged, ſo let theſe ſignes be ſuppreſſed. If they be teares of anger to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thy diſpleaſure, they ſhould not here haue bene ſhed where all anger was buried but none deſerued. If they be teares of ſorrow and duties to the dead, they are beſtowed in vaine where the dead is reuiued. If they be teares of ioy ſtilled from the flowers of thy good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, fewer of theſe would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and fitter were other tokens to expreſſe thy contentment. And therefore <hi>O Woman, why doeſt thou weepe?</hi> would our eyes be ſo drie, if ſuch eye-ſtreames were behouefull? Yea, would not the heauens raine teares if thy ſuppoſals were truths? Did not Angels alwaies in their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſemblances repreſent their Lords inuiſible pleaſures, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing their ſhapes in the drift of his intentions? When God was incenſed they brandiſhed
<pb facs="tcp:18234:143"/> ſwords: when he was appeaſed, they ſheathed them in ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards: when he would defend, they reſembled ſouldiers, when he would terrifie they tooke terrible formes, and when he would comfort, they carried mirth in their eyes, ſweetneſſe in their countenance, mildneſſe in their words, fauour, grace and comelineſſe in their whole preſence. Why then doeſt thou weepe, ſeeing vs to reioyce? Doeſt thou imagine vs to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate from our nature, or to forget any dutie, whoſe ſtate is neither ſubiect to change, nor capable of the leaſt offence? Art thou more priuie to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of our eternall God, than we that are daily attendants at his throne of glory? O woman, deeme not amiſſe againſt ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent euidence, and at our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt exchange thy ſorrow for our ioy.</p>
                  <p>But ô glorious Angels, why
<pb facs="tcp:18234:144"/> do ye moue her to ioy, if you know why ſhe weepeth? Alas, ſhe weepeth for the loſſe of him without whom all ioy is to her but matter of new griefe. While he liued, euery place where ſhe found him, was to her a Paradiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euery ſeaſon wherein he was enioyed, a perpetuall ſpring, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery exerciſe wherein he was ſerued, a ſpeciall felicitie: the ground whereon he went, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to yeeld her ſweeter foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: the ayre wherein he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, became to her ſpirit of life, being once ſanctified in his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred breaſt. In ſumme, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence brought with it an heauen of delights, and his departure ſeemed to leaue an eclipſe in all things. And yet euen the places that he had once honored with the acceſſe of his perſon, were to her ſo many ſweet Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, which in his abſence ſhe vſed as chappels and altars, to offer vp her prayers, feeling in
<pb facs="tcp:18234:144"/> them long after, the vertue of his former preſence. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to feed her with conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of his well being, is but to ſtrengthen her feare of his euill, and the alledging of likelihoods by thoſe that know the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, importeth the cauſe to be ſo lamentable, that they are vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it ſhould be knowne. Your obſcure glancing at the truth, is no ſufficient acquittance of her griefe, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe out of theſe diſioyned gheſts ſpell the words that muſt be the concluſion of her complaint. Tell her then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly what is become of her Lord, if you meane to deliuer her out of theſe dumpes, ſith what elſe ſoeuer you ſay of him, doth but draw more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to her ſore, and rather anger it than any way aſſwage it. Yet hearken ô <hi>Mary,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their ſpeeches. Thinke what anſwer thou wilt giue them, ſith they preſſe thee with
<pb facs="tcp:18234:145"/> ſo ſtrong perſwaſion. But I doubt that thy wits are ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with too thicke a miſt, to admit theſe vnknowne beames of their pale light. Thou art ſo wholy inherited by the bloudy tragedie of thy ſlaughtered Lord, and his death and dead body hath gotten ſo abſolute a conqueſt ouer all thy powers, that neither thy ſenſe can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, nor thy minde conceiue any other obiect than his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered coarſe.</p>
                  <p>Thy eyes ſeeme to tell thee that euery thing inuiteth thee to weepe, carrying ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew, as though all that thou ſeeſt were attyred in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to ſolemnize with generall conſent the funerall of the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Thy teares perſwade thee that all ſounds and voyces are tuned with mournfull notes, and that the Eccho of thine owne wailings, is the cry of the very ſtones and trees, as though (the
<pb facs="tcp:18234:145"/> cauſe of thy teares being ſo vnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall) God to the rocks and woods, had inſpired a feeling of thine and their common loſſe. And therefore it ſoundeth to thee as a ſtrange queſtion, to aske thee why thou weepeſt, ſith all that thou ſeeſt and heareſt, ſeemeth to induce thee, yea, to enforce thee to weepe.</p>
                  <p>If thou ſeeſt any thing that beareth colour of mirth, it is vnto thee like the rich ſpoiles of a vanquiſhed kingdome, in the eye of a captiue Prince, which puts him in mind what he had, not what he hath, and are but vpbraidings of his loſſe, and whetſtones of ſharper ſorrow. Whatſoeuer thou heareſt that moueth delight, it preſenteth the miſſe of thy maiſters ſpeeches, which as they were the onely Harmony that thy eares affected, ſo they being now ſtopped with a deathfull ſilence, all other words and tunes of comfort are
<pb facs="tcp:18234:146"/> to thee but an <hi>Iſraelites</hi> muſicke vpon <hi>Babylons</hi> bancks, memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a loſt felicitie, and proofes of a preſent vnhappineſſe. And though loue increaſeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of thy loſſe, which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the meaneſt things, and doubleth the eſtimate of things that are precious: yet thy faith teaching thee the infinite dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of thy Maiſter, and thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding being no dull ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to learne ſo well liked a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it fell out to be the bittereſt part of thy miſerie, that thou diddeſt ſo well know how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite the loſſe was that made thee miſerable.</p>
                  <p>This is the cauſe that thoſe very Angels, in whom all things make remonſtrance of triumph and ſolace, are vnto thee occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of new griefe. For their gracious and louely countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, remember thee, that thou haſt loſt the beauty of the world, and the higheſt marke of true
<pb facs="tcp:18234:146"/> loues ambition. Their ſweet lookes and amiable features tell thee, that the heauen of thy eyes which was the reuerend Maieſty of thy Maſters face, once ſhined with farre more pleaſing graces, but is now disfigured with the dreadfull formes of death. In ſumme, they were to thee, like the gliſtering ſparkes of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Diamond, and like pictures of dead and decayed beauties, ſignes, not ſalues of thy calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, memorials, not medicines of thy misfortune. Thy eyes were too well acquainted with the truth, to accept a ſupply of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes: and as comelineſſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and glory, were neuer in any other ſo truely at home and ſo perfectly in their prime, as in the perſon and ſpeeches of thy Lord: ſo cannot thy thoughts but be like ſtrangers in any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine delight. For in them all thou ſeeſt no more but ſome ſcattered crums, and hungrie
<pb facs="tcp:18234:147"/> morſels of thy late plentifull banquets, and findeſt a dim re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of thy former light, which like a flaſh of lightning, in a cloſe and ſtormie night, ſerueth thee but to ſee thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent infelicitie, and the better to know the horrour of the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thou thinkeſt therefore thy ſelfe blameleſſe, both in wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for thy loſſe, and in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing other comfort: Yet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courteſie affoord theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels an anſwer, ſith their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie viſiting thee, deſerueth much more, and thou (if not too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull) canſt allow them no leſſe.</p>
                  <p>Alas (ſaith ſhe) what needeth my anſwer, where the miſerie it ſelfe ſpeaketh, and the loſſe is manifeſt? My eyes haue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them with teares, my breaſt with ſighes, and my heart with throbs, what need I alſo puniſh my tongue, or wound my ſoule,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:147"/> with a new rehearſall of ſo do le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a miſchance? <hi>They haue taken away,</hi> O vnfortunate word, <hi>they haue taken away my Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O afflicted woman;</hi> why thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou this word ſo vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate? It may be the Angels haue taken him, more ſolemnely to entombe him: and ſith earth hath done her laſt homage, haply the Quires of heauen are alſo deſcended to defray vnto him their funerall duties.</p>
                  <p>It may be that the <hi>Centurion</hi> and the reſt, that did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him on the croſſe to be the Sonne of God, haue bene touched with remorſe, and goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with pricke of conſcience, and being deſirous to ſatisfie for their haynous offence, haue now taken him, more honorably to interre him, and by their ſeruice to his body ſought forgiueneſſe, and ſued the pardon of their guiltie ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Peraduenture ſome ſecret diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:148"/> haue wrought this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, and maugre the watch ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him from hence, with due honour to preſerue him in ſome better place, and therefore being yet vncertaine who hath him, there is no ſuch cauſe to lament, ſith the greater probabilities, march on the better ſide. Why doeſt thou call ſorrow before it commeth, which without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling commeth on thee too faſt? yea, why doeſt thou create ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row where it is not, ſith thou haſt true ſorrow enough, though imagined ſorrowes helpe not? It is folly to ſuppoſe the worſt where the beſt may be hoped for: and euerie miſhap bringeth griefe enough with it, though we with our feares do not go firſt to meet it. Quiet then thy ſelfe till time try out the truth, and it may be thy feare will proue greater than thy misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                  <p>But I know thy loue is little
<pb facs="tcp:18234:148"/> helped with this leſſon: for the more it loueth, the more it fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: and the more deſirous to enioy, the more doubtfull it is to loſe. It neither hath meaſure in hopes, nor meane in feares: hoping the beſt vpon the leaſt ſurmiſes, and fearing the worſt vpon the weakeſt grounds. And yet both fearing and hoping at one time, neither feare with-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hope from the higheſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts nor hope can ſtrengthen feare againſt the ſmalleſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but maugre all feares, loues hopes will mount to the higheſt pitch, and maugre all hopes, loues feares will ſtoupe to the loweſt downe-come. To bid thee therefore hope, is not to forbid thee to feare, and though it may be for the beſt, that thy Lord is taken from thee, yet ſith it may alſo be for the worſt, that will neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thee.</p>
                  <p>Thou thinkeſt, hope doth
<pb facs="tcp:18234:149"/> enough to keepe thy heart from breaking, &amp; feare little enough to force thee to no more than weeping, ſith it is as likely that he hath bene taken away vpon hatred by his enemies, as vpon loue by his friends.</p>
                  <p>For hitherto (ſayeſt thou) his friends haue all failed him, and his foes preuailed againſt him; and as they would not defend him aliue, are leſſe likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him dead, ſo they that thought one life too little to take from him, are not vnlikely after death to wrecke new rage vpon him.</p>
                  <p>And though this doubt were not, yet whoſoeuer hath taken him, hath wronged me, in not acquainting me with it: for to take away mine without my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, can neither be offered with out iniurie, nor ſuffered without ſorrow. And as for <hi>Ieſus,</hi> he was my <hi>Ieſus,</hi> my Lord, and my Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. He was mine becauſe he was
<pb facs="tcp:18234:149"/> giuen vnto me, &amp; borne for me: he was the author of my being, and ſo my father; he was the worker of my well doing, and therefore my Sauiour; he was the price of my ranſome, and thereby my Redeemer: he was my Lord to command me, my maiſter to inſtruct me, my paſtor to feede me. He was mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his loue was mine, and when he gaue me his loue, he gaue me himſelfe, ſith loue is no gift except the giuer be giuen with it, yea it is no loue, vnleſſe it be as liberall of that it is, as of that it hath. Finally, if the meate be mine that I eate, the life mine wherewith I liue, or he mine, all whoſe life, labours, and death were mine, then dare I boldly ſay that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is mine, ſith on his body I feed, by his loue I liue, and to my good without any neede of his owne, hath he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, laboured, and dyed. And therefore though his Diſciples,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:150"/> though the <hi>Centurion,</hi> yea though the Angels haue taken him, they haue done me wrong, in defeating me of my right, ſith I neuer meane to reſigne my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
                  <p>But what if he hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way himſelfe, wilt thou alſo lay iniuſtice to his charge? Though he be thine, yet thine to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not to obey; thy Lord to diſpoſe of thee, and not to be by thee diſpoſed: and therefore, as it is no reaſon that the ſeruant ſhould be maiſter of his maiſters ſecrets, ſo might he, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture ſo hath he, remoued without acquainting thee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, reuiuing himſelfe with the ſame power with which he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thy dead brother, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the words that he often vttered of his reſurrection. It may be thou wilt ſay, that a gift once giuen, cannot be reuoked, and therefore though it were before in his choiſe, not to giue
<pb facs="tcp:18234:150"/> himſelfe vnto thee, yet the deed of gift being once made, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken from thee, neither can the donor diſpoſe of his gift without the poſſeſſors priuity. And ſith this is a rule in the law of nature, thou maiſt imagine it a breach of equine, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of thy right, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey himſelfe away without thy conſent.</p>
                  <p>But to this I will anſwer thee with thine owne ground. For if he be thine by being giuen thee once: thou art his by as many gifts, as dayes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being abſolute owner of thee, is likewiſe full owner of whatſoeuer is thine: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently becauſe he is thine, he is alſo his owne, and ſo nothing lyable vnto thee, for taking him ſelfe from thee.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but he is my Lord (ſayeſt thou) and in this reſpect, bound to keepe me, at the leaſt bound not to kill me: and ſith killing
<pb facs="tcp:18234:151"/> is nothing but a ſeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ring of life from the body, he being the chiefe life both of my ſoule and bodie, cannot poſſibly go from me, but he muſt with a double death kill me. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being my Lord, and bound to protect his ſeruant, it is againſt all lawes that I ſhould be thus forſaken.</p>
                  <p>But ô cruell tongue, why pleadeſt thou thus againſt him, whoſe caſe I feare me is ſo piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that it might rather moue all tongues to pleade for him, being peraduenture in their hands, whoſe vumercifull hearts make themſelues merry with his miſerie, and build the triumphs of their impious victorie vpon the dolefull ruines of his diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced glorie? And now (ô griefe) becauſe I know not where he is. I cannot imagine how to helpe, for they haue taken him away, and I know not where they haue put him.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18234:151"/>
                  <p>Alas <hi>Mary,</hi> why doeſt thou conſume thy felfe with theſe cares? His father knoweth, and he will helpe him. The Angels know, and they will guard him. His owne ſoule knoweth, and that will aſſiſt him. And what neede then is there, that thou ſilly woman ſhouldeſt know it, that canſt no way profit him? But I feele in what vaine thy pulſe beateth, and by thy deſire I diſcouer thy diſeaſe. Though both heauen and earth did know it, and the whole world had notice of it, yet except thou alſo wert made priuie vnro it, thy woes would be as great, and thy teares as many. That others ſee the Sunne, doth not lighten thy darkneſſe, neither can others eating ſatisfie thy hunger. The more there be that know of him, the greater is thy ſorrow, that among ſo many thou art not thought worthy to be one. And the more there be that may
<pb facs="tcp:18234:152"/> helpe him, the move it grieueth thee that thy poore helpe is not accepted among them. Though thy knowiedge needeth not, thy loue doth deſire it, and though it auaile not, thy deſire wil ſeeke it. If all know it, thou wouldeſt know it with all: if no other, thou wouldeſt know it alone, and from whom ſoeuer it be concealed, it muſt be no ſecret to thee. Though the knowledge would diſcomfort thee, yet know it thou wilt, yea though it would kill thee, thou couldeſt not forbeare it.</p>
                  <p>Thy Lord to thy loue is like drinke to the thirſtie, which if they cannot haue, they die for drouth, being long without it they pine away with longing. And as men in extremitie of thirſt are ſtill dreaming of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, brookes, and ſprings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neuer able to haue other thought, or to vtter other word but of drinke and moiſture: ſo
<pb facs="tcp:18234:152"/> louers in the vehemencie of their paſſion, can neither thinke nor ſpeake but of that they loue, and if that be once miſſing, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part is both an eye to watch, and an eare to liſten, what hope or newes may be had. If it be good, they die till they heare it, though bad yet they cannot liue without it. Of the good, they hope that it is the very beſt; and of the euill, they feare it to be the worſt: and yet though neuer ſo good they pine till it be told, and be it neuer ſo euill, they are importunate to know it. And when they once know it, they can neither beare the ioy nor brooke the ſorrow, but as well the one as the other is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to kill them.</p>
                  <p>And this, ô <hi>Mary,</hi> I gueſſe to be the cauſe why the Angels would not tell thee thy Lords eſtate. For if it had beene to thy liking, thou wouldeſt haue died for ioy, if otherwiſe thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb facs="tcp:18234:153"/> haue ſunke downe for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And therefore they leaue this newes for him to deliuer, whoſe word if it giue thee a wound, is alſo a ſalue to cure it, though neuer ſo deadly.</p>
                  <p>But alas afflicted ſoule, why doth it ſo deepely grieue thee, that thou knoweſt not where he is? Thou canſt not better him if he be well, thou canſt as little ſuccour him if he be ill: and ſith thou feareſt that he is rather ill than well, why ſhouldeſt thou know it, ſo to end thy hopes in miſhap, and thy great feares in farre greater ſorrowes? Alas, to aske thee why, is in a manner to aske one halfe ſtarued why he is hungrie. For as thy Lord is the food of thy thoughts, the reliefe of thy wiſhes, the onely repaſt of all thy deſires: ſo is thy loue a continuall hunger, and his ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſence vnto thee an extreame famine. And therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell though thou art ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="tcp:18234:153"/> to heare, yea to deuoure any, be it neuer ſo bitter notice of him, ſith thy hunger is moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and nothing but he able to content it. And albeit the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his harmes ſhould worke the ſame in thy mind, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome meat worketh in a ſick ſtomacke: yet if it once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne him that thou loueſt, thy hungrie loue could not temper it ſelfe from it, though after with many wringing gripes, it did a long and vnpleaſant pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                  <p>But why doth thy ſorrow queſt ſo much vpon the place where he is? were it not enough for thee to know who had him, but that thou muſt alſo know in what place he is beſtowed? A worſe place than a graue no man will offer, and many farre better many titles will allow: and therefore thou maiſt boldly thinke, that whereſoeuer he be, he is in a place fitter for him
<pb facs="tcp:18234:154"/> than where he was. Thy ſiſter <hi>Martha</hi> confeſſed him to be the Sonne of God, and with her confeſſion agreed thy beliefe. And what place more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the ſonne, than to be with his Father, the buſineſſe for which he hath bene ſo long from him, being now fully fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed? If he be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as thou diddeſt once beleeue, it was ſaid of him, <hi>That he ſhould aſcend on high, and leade our captiuitie cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</hi> And what is this height, but heauen? what our captiuitie but death? Death therefore is become his captiue, and it is like that with the ſpoyles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he is aſcended in triumph to eternall life.</p>
                  <p>But if thou canſt not lift thy minde to ſo fauourable a beliefe, yet maieſt thou very well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he is in Paradiſe. For if he came to repaire <hi>Adams</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, and to be the common pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of our redemption, as <hi>Adam</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18234:154"/> was of our originall infection: reaſon ſeemeth to require, that hauing endured all his life the penaltie of <hi>Adams</hi> exile, he ſhould after death re-enter poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that inheritance which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt: that the ſame place that was the neaſt where ſinne was firſt hatched, may be now the child-bed of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And if ſorrow at the croſſe did not make thee as deafe, as at the Tombe it maketh thee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull, thou diddeſt in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hereof heare himſelfe ſay to one of the theeues, that the ſame day he ſhould be with him in Paradiſe. And if it be reaſon that no ſhadow ſhould be more priuiledged than the body, no figure in more account than the figured truth, why ſhouldeſt thou beleeue that <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> haue bene in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe theſe many ages, &amp; that he who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they but as tipes reſembled, ſhould be excluded from thence?
<pb facs="tcp:18234:155"/> He excelled them in life, ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them in miracles, he was farre beyond them in dignitie: why then ſhould not his place be farre aboue, or at the leaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with theirs, ſith their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues were ſo farre inferiour vnto his?</p>
                  <p>And yet if the baſeneſſe and miſery of his paſſion haue layd him ſo low in thy conceit, that thou thinkeſt Paradiſe too high a place to be likely to haue him: the very loweſt roome that any reaſon can aſſigne him, cannot be meaner than the boſome of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And ſith God in his life did ſo often acknowledge him for his Sonne, it ſeemeth the ſlendereſt preheminence that he can giue him aboue other men, that being his holy <hi>one, he ſhould not in his body ſee corruption,</hi> but be free among the dead, repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing both in body and ſoule, where other Saints are in ſoule onely. Let not therefore the
<pb facs="tcp:18234:155"/> place where he is trouble thee, ſith it cannot be worſe than his graue, and infinite coniectures make probability that it cannot but be better.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe that he were yet remaining on earth, and taken by others out of his Tombe, what would it auaile thee to know where he were? If he be with ſuch as loue and honour him, they will be as warie to keepe him, as they are loth he ſhould be loſt: and therefore will either often change, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer confeſſe the place, knowing ſecreſie to be the ſureſt locke to defend ſo great a treaſure. If thoſe haue taken him, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and maligne him, thou maiſt well iudge him paſt thy recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, when he is once in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo cruell owners.</p>
                  <p>Thou wouldeſt haply make ſale of thy liuing, and ſeeke him by ranſome. But it is not likely they would ſell him to be
<pb facs="tcp:18234:156"/> honoured, that bought him to be murthered.</p>
                  <p>If price would not ſerue, thou wouldeſt fall to prayer. But how can prayer ſoften ſuch flinty hearts? And if they ſcorned ſo many teares offered for his life, as little will they regard thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie for his coarſe.</p>
                  <p>If neither price nor prayer would preuaile, thou wouldeſt attempt it by force. But alas ſilly ſouldier, thy armes are too weake to manage weapons, and the iſſue of thy affault, would be the loſſe of thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>If no other way would helpe, thou wouldeſt purloine him by ſtealth, and thinke thy ſelfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie in contriuing ſuch a theft. O <hi>Mary,</hi> thou art deceiued, for malice will haue many locks: and to ſteale him from a thiefe, that could ſteale him from the watch, requireth more cunning in the Art, than thy want of practiſe can affoord thee.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18234:156"/>
                  <p>Yet if theſe be the cauſes that thou enquired of the place, thou ſheweſt the force of thy rare affection, and deſerueſt the Lawrell of a perfect louer.</p>
                  <p>But to feele more of their ſweetneſſe, I will poune theſe ſpices, and dwell a while in the peruſe of thy reſolute ſeruour.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, can thy loue enrich thee when thy goods are gone, or a dead coarſe repay the value of thy ranſome? Becauſe he had neither bed to be borne in, nor graue to be buried in, wilt thou therefore rather be poore with him, than rich without him?</p>
                  <p>Againe, if thou hadſt to ſue to ſome cruell Scribe or Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that is, to an heart boyling in rancor, with an heart burning in loue, for a thing of him aboue all things deteſted, of thee aboue all things deſired: as his enemie to whom thou ſueſt, and his friend for whom thou intreareſt: canſt thou thinke it poſſible for
<pb facs="tcp:18234:157"/> this ſute to ſpeede? Could thy loue repaire thee from his rage, or ſuch a tyrant ſtoupe to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans teares?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if thy Lord might be recouered by violence, art thou ſo armed in compleat loue, that thou thinkeſt it ſufficient har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? or doth thy loue indue thee with ſuch a <hi>Iudiths</hi> ſpirit, or lend thee ſuch <hi>Sampſons</hi> locks, that thou canſt breake open huge gates, or foyle whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Is thy loue ſo ſure a ſhield, that no blow can breake it, or ſo ſharpe a dint, that no force can withſtand it? Can it thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſexe, change nature, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede all Art?</p>
                  <p>But of all other courſes woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou aduenture a theft to obtaine thy deſire? A good deed muſt be well done, and a worke of mercy without breach of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. It were a ſinne to ſteale prophane treaſure, but to ſteale an annointed Prophet, can be no
<pb facs="tcp:18234:157"/> leſſe than ſacriledge. And what greater ſtaine to thy Lord, to his doctrine, and to thy ſelfe, than to ſee thee his Diſciple publikely executed for an open theft?</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Mary,</hi> vnleſſe thy loue haue better warrant than common ſenſe, I can hardly ſee how ſuch deſignements can be approued.</p>
                  <p>Approued (ſaith ſhe,) I would to God the execution were as eaſie as the proofe, and I ſhould not long bewaile my vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate loſſe.</p>
                  <p>To others it ſeemeth ill to preferre loue before riches, but to loue it ſeemeth worſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre any thing before it ſelfe. Cloath him with plates of ſiluer that ſhiuereth for cold, or fill his purſe with treaſure that pineth with hunger, &amp; ſee whether the plates will warme him, or the treaſure feede him. No, no, he will giue vs all his plates for a woollen garment, and all his
<pb facs="tcp:18234:158"/> money for a meales meate. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſupply fitteth not with euery neede, and the loue of ſo ſweete a Lord hath no correſpondence in worldly wealth. Without him I were poore, though Empreſſe of the world. With him I were rich though I had nothing elſe. They that haue moſt are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted richeſt and they thought to haue moſt, that haue all they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: and therefore as in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the vttermoſt of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſo he alone is the ſumme of all my ſubſtance. It were too happy an exchange, to haue God for goods, and too rich a pouertie to enioy the onely treaſure of the world. If I were ſo fortunate a begger, I would diſdaine <hi>Salomons</hi> wealth, and my loue being ſo highly enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, my life ſhould neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of want.</p>
                  <p>And if all I am worth would not reach to his ranſome, what ſhould hinder to ſeeke him by
<pb facs="tcp:18234:158"/> intreaty? Though I were to ſue to the gaeateſt Tyrant, yet the equitie of my ſute is more than halfe a graunt. If many drops ſoften the hardeſt ſtones, why ſhould not many teares ſupple the moſt ſtony hearts? What an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſo fiery that may not be quenched with eye-water; ſith a weeping ſuppliant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ebateth the edge of more than a Lyons furie? My ſute it ſelfe would ſue for me, and ſo dolefull a coarſe would quicken pitty in the moſt yron hearts. But ſuppoſe that by touching a ranckled ſore, my touch ſhould anger it, and my petition at the firſt incenſe him that heard it: he would percaſe reuile me in words, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his owne iniurie would recoyle with remorſe, and be vnto me a patron to proceede in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. And if he ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie his words with blowes, and his blowes with wounds, it may be my ſtripes would
<pb facs="tcp:18234:159"/> ſmart in his guiltie minde, and his conſcience bleed in my blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wounds, and my innocent bloud ſo entender his Adamant heart, that his owne inward fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings would pleade my cauſe, and peraduenture obtaine my ſute.</p>
                  <p>But if through extremity of ſpite he ſhould happen to kil me, his offence might eaſily redound to my felicitie. For he would be as carefull to hide whom he had vniuſtly murthered, as him whom hee had felloniouſly ſtolen: and ſo it is like that he would hide me in the ſame place where he had layd my Lord. And as he hated vs both for one cauſe, him for challenging, and me for acknowledging that he was the Meſſias: ſo would he vſe vs both after one manner. And thus what comfort my body wanted, my ſoule ſhould enioy, in ſeeing a part of my ſelfe part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my Maiſters miſery: with
<pb facs="tcp:18234:159"/> whom to be miſerable, I reckon an higher fortune, than without him to be moſt happy.</p>
                  <p>And if no other meane would ſerue to recouer him but force, I ſee no reaſon why it might not very well become me. None will barre me from defending my life, which the leaſt worme in the right nature hath leaue to preſerue. And ſith he is to me ſo deare a life, that without him all life is death, nature authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth my feeble forces, to employ their vttermoſt in ſo neceſſary an attempt. Neceſſitie addeth abilitie, and loue doubleth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, and it often happeneth that nature armed with loue, and preſſed with neede, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ſelfe in might, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth all hope in ſucceſſe. And as the equitie of the cauſe doth breath courage into the defenders, making them the mote willing to fight, and the leſſe vnwilling to dye ſo guiltie
<pb facs="tcp:18234:160"/> conſciences are euer timorous, ſtill ſtarting with ſodaine frightts, and afraid of their own ſuſpitions, ready to yeeld before the aſſault, vpon diſtreſſe of their cauſe, and deſpaire of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Sith therefore to reſcue an innocent, to recouer a right, &amp; to redreſſe ſo deepe a wrong, is ſo iuſt a quarrell: nature will enable me, loue encourage me, grace confirme me, and the iudge of all iuſtice fight in my behalfe.</p>
                  <p>And if it ſeeme vnfitting to my ſexe in talke, much more in practiſe to deale with materiall affaires: yet when ſuch a cauſe happeneth as neuer had patterne, ſuch effects muſt follow as are without example. There was neuer any body of a God but one, neither ſuch a body ſtolne but now, neuer ſuch a ſtealth vnreuenged but this. Sith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Angels neglect it; and men forge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But ſuppoſe that my force were vnable to winne him by an open enterpriſe, what ſcruple ſhould keepe me from ſeeking him by ſecret meanes? yea and by plaine ſtealth, it will be thought a ſinne, and condemned for a theft. O ſweet ſinne, why was not I the firſt that did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thee? Why did I ſuffer any other ſinner to preuent me? For ſtealing from God his honour I was called a ſinner, and vnder that title was ſpread my infamie. But for ſtealing God from a falſe owner, I was not worthy to be called a ſinner, becauſe it had bene too high a glory. If this be ſo great a ſinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, and ſo haynous a theft, let others make choiſe of what titles they will, but for my part I would refuſe to be an Angell, I would not wiſh to be a Saint, I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be eſteemed either iuſt or
<pb facs="tcp:18234:161"/> true, and I ſhould be beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented if I might but liue and die ſuch a ſinner, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for ſuch a theft. When I heard my Lord make ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable a promiſe to the theefe vpon the Croſſe, that he ſhould that day be with him in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, I had halfe an enuie at that theeues good fortune, &amp; wiſhed my ſelfe in the theefes place, ſo I might haue enioyed the fruit of his promiſe. But if I could be ſo happy a theefe, as to commit this theft, if that wiſh had taken effect, I would now vnwiſh it againe, and ſcorne to be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theefe than my ſelfe, ſith my booty could make me hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than any other theefes fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie. And what though my fellonie ſhould be called in queſtion, in what reſpect ſhould I need to feare? They would ſay, that I loued him too well; but that were ſoone diſproued, ſith where the worthineſſe is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:161"/> no loue can be enough. They would obiect that I ſtole anothers goods: and as for that, many ſure titles of my intereſt would auerre him to be mine, and his dead coarſe would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak than witneſſes ſhould faile to depoſe ſo certaine a truth. And if I had not a ſpeciall right vnto him, what ſhould moue me to venture my life for him? No no, if I were ſo happy a fellon, I ſhould feare no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall arraignment: I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare that the Angels would cite me to my anſwere; for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting them in the theft, ſith not the higheſt Seraphin in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but would deem it a higher ſtile than his owne, to be the theefe that had committed ſo glorious a robberie.</p>
                  <p>But alas, thus ſtand I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing what I would do, if I knew any thing of him, and in the meane time I neither know who hath him, nor where they

                  <p>O <hi>Mary,</hi> is it poſſible that thou haſt forgotten Ieſus? Faith hath written him in thy vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, loue in thy will, both feare and hope in thy memory: and how can all theſe Regiſters be ſo cancelled, that ſo plainely ſeeing, thou ſhouldeſt not know the contents?

She is ſo earneſt in ſeeking thee that ſhe can neither ſeeke nor thinke any other thing: and all her wits are ſo buſied in muſing vpon thee, that they draw all attention from her ſenſes, wherewith they ſhould diſcerne thee. Being therefore ſo attentiue to that ſhe thinketh, what maruell though ſhe marke not whom ſhe ſeeth: and ſith thou haſt ſo perfect notice of her thought and ſhe ſo little power to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thee by ſenſe, why deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou for whom ſhe ſeeketh, or why ſhe weepeth? Doeſt thou looke that ſhe ſhould anſwere, for thee I ſeeke, or for thee I
<pb facs="tcp:18234:164"/> weepe? vnleſſe thou wilt vnbend her thoughts, that her eyes may fully ſee thee: or while thou wilt be concealed, doeſt thou expect that ſhe ſhould be able to know thee?</p>
                  <p>But, ô <hi>Mary,</hi> not without cauſe doth he aske thee this queſtion. Thou wouldeſt haue him aliue, and yet thou weepeſt becauſe thou doeſt not find him dead. Thou art ſome that he is not here, and for this very cauſe thou ſhouldeſt rather be glad. For if he were dead I it is moſt likely he ſhould be here; but not being here, it is a ſigne that he is aliue. He reioyceth to be out of his graue, and thou weepeſt becauſe he is not in it. He will not lie any where, and thou ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt for not knowing where he lyeth. Alas, why be waileſt thou his glory, and iniureſt the reuiuing of his body as the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery of his coarſe? He being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, for what dead man mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb facs="tcp:18234:165"/> thou, and he being preſent, whoſe abſence doeſt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>But ſhe taking him to be a Gardener ſaid vnto him, O Lord, if thou haſt carried him from hence, tell me where thou haſt layd him, and I will take him away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O wonderfull effects of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> loue, if loue be a languor, how liueth ſhe by it? If loue be her life, how dyeth ſhe in it? If it bereaued her of ſenſe, how did ſhe ſee the Angels? If it quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her of ſenſe, why knew ſhe not Ieſus? Doeſt thou ſeeke for one, whom when thou haſt found thou knoweſt not? or if thou doſt know him when thou findeſt him, why doeſt thou ſeek when thou haſt him?</p>
                  <p>Behold <hi>Ieſus</hi> is come, and the partie whom thou ſeekeſt, is he that talketh with thee, ô <hi>Mary</hi> call vp thy wits, and open thine eyes. Hath thy Lord liued ſo long laboured ſo much died with ſuch paine, and ſhed ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:18234:165"/> ſhowers of bloud, to come to no higher preferment, than to be a Gardener? And haſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſuch coſt, ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſo many teares, for no better man than a ſilly Garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Alas, is the ſorry Garden the beſt inheritance that thy loue can affoord him, or a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners office the higheſt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that thou wilt allow him? It had bene better he had liued to haue bene Lord of thy Caſtle, than with his death ſo dearely to haue bought ſo ſmall a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. But thy miſtaking, hath in it a further myſterie. Thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt not amiſſe, though thy ſight be deceiued. For as our firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the ſtate of grace and innocencie, was placed in the Garden of pleaſure, and the firſt office allotted him was to be a Gardener: ſo the firſt man that euer was in glorie, appeareth firſt in a Garden, and preſenteth himſelfe in a Gardeners like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:166"/> that the beginnings of glorie might reſemble the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of innocencie and grace. And as the Gardener was the fall of mankinde, the parent of ſinne, and authour of death, ſo is this Gardener the raiſer of our ruines, the ranſome of our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; and the reſtorer of life. In a Garden <hi>Adam</hi> was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and taken captiue by the deuill. In a Garden Chriſt was betrayed and taken priſoner by the Iewes. In a Garden <hi>Adam</hi> was condemned to earne his bread with the ſweat of his browes. And after a free gift of the bread of Angels in the laſt Supper, in a Garden Chrid did earne it vs with a bloudy ſweate of his whole body. By diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient eating the fruite of a tree, our right to that Garden was by <hi>Adam</hi> forfeited, and by the obedient death of Chriſt vpon a tree a farre better right is now recouered. When <hi>Adam</hi> had
<pb facs="tcp:18234:166"/> ſinned in the Garden of pleaſure, he was there apparelled in dead beaſts skinnes, that his garment might betoken his graue, and his liuery of death agree with his condemnation to die. And now to defray the debt of that ſinne, in this Garden Chriſt lay cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d in the dead mans ſhrowd, and buried in his Tombe, that as our harmes began, ſo they might end; and ſuch places and meanes as were the premiſes to our miſerie; might be alſo the concluſions of our misfortune. For this did Chriſt in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, inuite vs to an heauenly banquet after he was come into this Garden, and had reaped his myrrhe, and his ſpice, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne vs of the ioy that after this harueſt ſhould preſently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, namely when hauing ſowed in this Garden a body, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie whereof was ſignified by thoſe ſpices, he now reaped the ſame, neither capable of death,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:167"/> nor ſubiect to corruption. For this alſo was <hi>Mary</hi> permitted to miſtake, that we might be informed of the myſterie, and ſee how aptly the courſe of our redemption did anſwer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of our condemnation.</p>
                  <p>But though he be the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener that hath planted the tree of grace, and reſtored vs to the vſe and eating of the fruites of life. Though it be he that ſoweth his giftes in our ſoules, quickening in vs the ſeeds of vertue, and rooting out of vs the weedes of ſinne: yet is he neuertheleſſe the ſame <hi>Ieſus</hi> he was, and the borrowed preſence of a meane laborer neither alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his perſon, nor diminiſheth his right to his diuine titles.</p>
                  <p>Why then canſt thou not as well ſee what in truth he is, as what in ſhew he ſeemeth? but becauſe thou ſeeſt more than thou diddeſt beleeue, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt more thrn thy faith ſerueth
<pb facs="tcp:18234:167"/> thee to ſeek: and for this though thy loue was worthy to ſee him, yet thy faith was vnworthy to know him.</p>
                  <p>Thou diddeſt ſeeke for him as dead, and therefore doeſt not know him ſeeing him aliue; and becauſe thou beleeueſt not of him as he is, thou doeſt onely ſee him as he ſeemeth to be.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſay thou art faultleſſe, ſith thou art ſo lame in thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thy fault deſerueth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, becauſe thy charitie is ſo great: and therefore ô mercifull <hi>Ieſu,</hi> giue me leaue to excuſe whom thou art minded to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue.</p>
                  <p>She thought to haue found thee as ſhe left thee, and ſhe ſought thee as ſhe did laſt ſee thee, being ſo ouercome with ſorow for thy death, that ſhe had neither roome nor reſpite in her minde for any hope of thy life: and being ſo deepely interred in the griefe of thy buriall that ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:18234:168"/> could not raiſe her thoughts to any conceit of thy reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>For in the graue where <hi>Ioſeph</hi> buried thy body, <hi>Mary</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it entombed her ſoule, and ſo ſtraightly combined it with thy coarſe, that ſhe could with more eaſe ſunder her ſoule from her owne body that liueth by it, than from thy dead body, with which her loue did burie it: for it is more thine and in thee, than her owne or in her ſelfe; and therefore in ſeeking thy body, ſhe ſeeketh her owne ſoule, as with the loſſe of the one, ſhe alſo loſt the other. What maruell then though ſenſe faile, when the ſoule is loſt, ſith the lanterne muſt needes be darke when the light is out?</p>
                  <p>Reſtore vnto her therfore her ſoule that lieth impriſoned in thy body, and ſhe will ſoone both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer her ſenſe, and diſcouer her errour. For alas it is no errour y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18234:168"/> proceedeth of any will to erre, and it riſeth as much of vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie or affection, as of default in faith. Regard not the errour of a woman, but the loue of a Diſciple, which ſupplyeth in it ſelfe what in faith it wanteth. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>If thou haſt carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him hence, tell me where thou haſt laide him, and I will take him away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O how learned is her igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and how skilfull her er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? She charged not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with thy remouing, nor ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to miſtruſt them for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee away, as though that her loue had taught her y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their helpe was needleſſe, where the thing remoued was remouer of it ſelfe. She did not requeſt them to enforme her where thou wert layd, as if ſhe had reſerued that queſtion for thy ſelfe to anſwer. But now he iudgeth thee ſo likely to be the authour of her loſſe, that halfe ſuppoſing thee
<pb facs="tcp:18234:169"/> guilty, ſhe ſueth a recouerie, and deſireth thee to tell her where the body is, as almoſt fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that thou art as priuie to the place, as well acquainted with the action. So that if ſhe be not altogether right, ſhe is not very much wrong, and ſhe erreth with ſuch ayme, that ſhe very little miſſeth the truth. Tell her therefore ô Lord, what thou haſt done with thy ſelfe, ſith it is fitteſt for thy owne ſpeech to vtter that which was onely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for thy owne power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
                  <p>But ô <hi>Mary,</hi> ſithens thou art ſo deſirous to know where thy <hi>Ieſus</hi> is, why doeſt thou not name him when thou askeſt for him? Thou ſaideſt to the Angels that they had taken away thy Lord, and now the ſecond time thou askeſt for him. Are thy thoughts ſo viſible, as at thy onely preſence to be ſeene; or ſo generall, that they poſſeſſe all
<pb facs="tcp:18234:169"/> when they are once in thee? When thou ſpeakeſt of him, what him doeſt thou meane, or how can a ſtranger vnderſtand thee when thou talkeſt of thy Lord? Hath the world no other Lords but thine? or is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding by no other name but (him) a ſufficient notice for whom thou demandeſt?</p>
                  <p>But ſuch is the nature of thy loue, thou iudgeſt that no other ſhould be entitled a Lord, ſith the whole world is too little for thy Lords poſſeſſion, and that thoſe few creatures that are, cannot chuſe but know him, ſith all the creatures of the world are too few to ſerue him. And as his worthineſſe can appay all loues, and his onely loue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent all hearts, ſo thou deemeſt him to be ſo well worthy to be owner of all thoughts, that no thought in thy conceit, can be well beſtowed vpon any other.</p>
                  <p>Yet thy ſpeeches ſeeme more
<pb facs="tcp:18234:170"/> ſudden than ſound, and more peremptory, than well ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Why doeſt thou ſay ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without any further cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that if this Gardener haue taken him, thou wilt take him from him? If he had him by right, in taking him away thou ſhouldſt do him wrong. If thou ſuppoſeſt he wrongfully tooke him, thou layeſt theft to his charge: and howſoeuer it be thou either condemneſt thy ſelfe for an vſurper, or him for a thiefe. And is this an effect of thy zealous loue, firſt to abaſe him from a God to a Gardener, and now to degrade him from a Gardener to a thiefe?</p>
                  <p>Thou ſhouldeſt alſo haue conſidered whether he tooke him vpon loue or malice. If it were for loue, thou maieſt aſſure thy ſelfe that he will be as wary to keepe, as he was venturous to get him, and therefore thy pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie was weake in ſaying, thou
<pb facs="tcp:18234:170"/> wouldeſt take him away before thou kneweſt where he was, ſith none is ſo ſimple to bewray their treaſure to a knowne thiefe. If he tooke him of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, thy offer to recouer him is an open defiance, ſith malice is as obſtinate in defending as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in offering wrong, and he that would be cruell againſt thy maiſters dead body, is likely to be more furious againſt his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>But thy loue had no leiſure to caſt ſo many doubts. Thy teares were Interpreters of thy words, and thy innocent meaning was written in thy dolefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Thine eyes were rather pleaders for pitty than Heraulds of wrath, and thy whole perſon preſented ſuch a patterne of thy extreame anguiſh, that no man from thy preſence could take in any other impreſſion. And therefore what thy words wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thy action ſupplied, and
<pb facs="tcp:18234:171"/> what his eare might miſtake his eye did vnderſtand.</p>
                  <p>It might be alſo that what he wrought in thy heart, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from thy ſight, and haply his voice and demeanour did import ſuch compaſſion of thy caſe, that he ſeemed as willing to affoord as thou deſireſt to haue his helpe. And ſo preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming by his behauiour, that thy ſuite ſhould not ſuffer repulſe, the tenour of thy requeſt doth but argue thy hope of a graunt.</p>
                  <p>But what is the reaſon that in all thy ſpeeches, which ſince the miſſe of thy maiſter thou haſt vttered, <hi>(where they haue put him)</hi> is alwayes a part? So thou ſaydeſt to the Apoſtles, the ſame to the Angels, and now thou doeſt repeate it to this ſuppoſed Garderner: very ſweete muſt this word be in thy heart, that is ſo often in thy mouth, &amp; it would neuet be ſo ready in thy tongue, if it were not very freſh in thy
<pb facs="tcp:18234:171"/> memory.</p>
                  <p>But what maruaile though it taſt ſo ſweete, that was firſt ſeaſoned in thy maiſters mouth? which as it was the treaſury of truth, the fountaine of life, and the onely quire of the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Harmonie, ſo whatſoeuer it deliuered, thine eare deuoured, and thy heart locked vp. And now that thou wanteſt himſelfe, thou haſt no other comfort but his words, which thou deemeſt ſo much the more effectuall to perſwade, in that they tooke their force from ſo heauenly a ſpeaker. His ſweeteneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that maketh this word ſo ſweete, and for loue of him thou repeateſt it ſo often, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he in the like caſe ſaid of thy brother, <hi>Where haue you put him?</hi> O how much doeſt thou affect his perſon, that findeſt ſo ſweete a feeling in his phraſe! How much deſireſt thou to ſee his countenance, that with ſo
<pb facs="tcp:18234:172"/> great deſire pronounceſt his wordes? And how willingly wouldeſt thou licke his ſacred feete, that ſo willingly vttereſt his ſhorteſt ſpeeches?</p>
                  <p>But what meaneſt thou to make ſo abſolute a promiſe, and ſo boldly to ſay, <hi>I will take him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? Ioſeph</hi> was afraid, and durſt not take downe his body from the Croſſe but by night, yea and then alſo not without <hi>Pilats</hi> warrant, but thou neither ſtayeſt vntill night, nor regardeſt <hi>Pilate,</hi> but ſtoutly promiſeſt that thou thy ſelfe wilt take him away.</p>
                  <p>What if he be in the pallace of the high Prieſt, and ſome ſuch maid as made Saint <hi>Peter</hi> denie his maiſter do begin to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with thee, wilt thou then ſtand to theſe words, I will take him away? Is thy courage ſo high aboue kinde, thy ſtrength ſo farre beyond thy ſexe, &amp; thy loue ſo much without meaſure, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou neither doeſt remember
<pb facs="tcp:18234:172"/> that all women are weake, not that thy ſelfe art but a woman? Thou exempteſt no place, thou preferreſt no perſon, thou ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt without feare, thou promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt without condition, thou makeſt no exception: as though nothing were impoſſible that thy loue ſuggeſteth.</p>
                  <p>But as the darkneſſe could not fright thee from ſetting forth before day, nor the watch feare thee from comming to the Tombe: as thou diddeſt reſolue to breake open the ſeales though with danger of thy life, and to remoue the ſtone from the graues mouth, though thy force could not ſerue thee: ſo what maruaile though thy loue being now more incenſed with the freſh wound of thy loſſe, it reſolue vpon any though neuer ſo hard aduentures?</p>
                  <p>Loue is not ruled with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but with loue. It neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth what can be, nor what

Loue is title iuſt enough and Armour ſtrong enough for all aſſaults, and it ſelfe a reward of all labours. It asketh no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, it reſpecteth no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie. Loues fruites are loues effects, and the gaines the paines. It conſidereth behoofe more than benefit, and what in dutie it ſhould, not what indeed it can.</p>
                  <p>But how can nature be ſo maiſtered with affection, that thou canſt take ſuch delight and carry ſuch loue to a dead coarſe? The mother how tenderly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhe loued her child aliue, yet ſhe cannot chuſe but loath him dead. The moſt louing Spouſe cannot endure the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of her deceaſſed husband, and whoſe embracements were delightſome in life, are euer moſt hatefull after death. Yea
<pb facs="tcp:18234:174"/> this is the nature of all, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of women, that the very conceit, much more the ſight of the departed ſtriketh into them ſo fearefull and vgly impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſtirreth in them ſo great horrour, that notwithſtanding the moſt vehement loue, they thinke long vntill the houſe is ridde of their very deareſt friends, when they are once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred in deaths vnlouely liueries. How then canſt thou endure to take vp his coarſe in thy hands, and to carry it thou knoweſt not thy ſelfe how farre, being eſpecially torne and mangled, and conſequently the more likely in ſo long time to be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
                  <p>Thy ſiſter was vnwilling that the graue of her owne brother ſhould be opened, and yet he was ſhrowded in ſheets, embal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſpices, and died an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie death, without any wound, bruſe or other harme,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:175"/> that might haſten his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this coarſe hath neither ſhrowd nor ſpice, ſith theſe are to be ſeene in the tombe, and there is not a part in his body but had ſome helpe to further it to decay; and art thou not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to ſee him, yea to touch him, yea to embrace and carry him naked in thine armes?</p>
                  <p>If thou haddeſt remembred Gods promiſe, that <hi>His holy one ſhould not ſee corruption:</hi> If thou haddeſt beleeued that his God-head remaining with his bodie, could haue preſerued it from periſhing, thy faith had bene more worthy of praiſe, but thy loue leſſe worthy of admiration, ſith the more corruptible thou diddeſt conceiue him, the more combers thou diddeſt determine to ouercome, and the greater was thy loue in being able to conquer them. But thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt haue thought thy oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rather harmes than helpes,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:175"/> if thou hadſt bene ſetled in that beleefe, and for ſo heauenly a coarſe embalmed with God, all earthly ſpices would haue ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a diſgrace. If likewiſe thou haddeſt firmely truſted vpon his reſurrection, I ſhould maruaile at thy conſtant deſignement, ſith all hazards in taking him ſhould haue bene with vſurie repaide, if lying in thy lappe, thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt haue ſeene him reuiued, and his disfigured and dead body beautified in thine armes with a diuine maieſtie. If thou haddeſt hoped ſo good fortune to thy waterie eyes, that they might haue bene firſt cleared with the beames of his deſired light, or that his eyes might haue bleſſed thee with the firſt fruites of his glorious lookes: If thou haddeſt imagined any likelihood to haue made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie thy dying heart with ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the firſt gaſpes of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing breath, or to haue heard
<pb facs="tcp:18234:176"/> the firſt words of his pleaſing voice: Finally if thou haddeſt thought to haue ſeene his iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries turned to honours, the markes of his miſerie to orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of glorie, and the depth of thy heauineſſe to ſuch an height of felicity, whatſoeuer thou haddeſt done to obtaine him had bene but a mite for a million, and too ſlender a price for ſo ſoueraigne a peniworth.</p>
                  <p>But hauing no ſuch hopes to vphold thee, and ſo many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to plonge thee in deſpaire, how could thy loue be ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as neither to feele a womans feare of ſo deformed a coarſe, nor to thinke the weight of the burthen too heauy for thy feeble armes, nor to be amated with a world of dangers that this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt did carry with it?</p>
                  <p>But affection cannot feare whom it affecteth, loue feeleth no load of him it loueth, neither can true frendſhip be frighted
<pb facs="tcp:18234:176"/> from reſcuing ſo affied a friend.</p>
                  <p>What meaneſt thou then, ô comfort of her life, to leaue ſo conſtant a wel-willer ſo long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted, and to puniſh her ſo much, that ſo well deſerueth pardon?

And ſith ſhe is nothing but what it pleaſeth thee, let her taſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of being onely thine. She did not follow the tide of thy better fortune to ſhift ſaile when the ſtreame did alter courſe. She began not to loue thee in thy life to leaue thee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death: Neither was ſhe ſuch a gueſt at thy table that meant to be a ſtranger in thy neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. She left thee not in thy low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ebbe, ſhe reuolted not from thy laſt extremitie: In thy life ſhe ſerued thee with her goods: in thy death ſhe departed not from the Croſſe: after death ſhe came to dwell with thee at thy

                  <p>Do not ſweete Lord any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger delay her. Behold ſhe hath attended thee theſe three dayes, and ſhe hath not what to eate, nor wherewith to foſter her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed ſoule, vnleſſe thou by diſcouering thy ſelfe doeſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vnto her the bread of thy body, and feede her with the food that hath in it all taſte of ſweetneſſe. If therefore thou wilt not haue her to faint in the way, refreſh her with that which her hunger requireth. For ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe cannot long enioy the life of her ſoule.</p>
                  <p>But feare not <hi>Mary,</hi> for thy teares will obtaine. They are to o mighty oratours to let any ſuit fall, and though they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:18234:177"/> at the moſt rigorous barre, yet haue they ſo perſwading a ſilence, &amp; ſo conquering a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that by yeelding they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, and by intreating they command. They tie the tongues of all accuſers, and ſoften the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the ſeuereſt Iudge. Yea they winne the inuincible, and binde the omnipotent. When they ſeeme moſt pitifull, they haue great power, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt forſaken they are more victorious. Repentant eyes are the Cellers of Angels, and penitent teares their ſweeteſt wines; which the ſauour of life perfumeth, the taſte of grace ſweeteneth, and the pureſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of returning innocencie highly beautifieth. This deaw of deuotion neuer faileth, but the Sunne of iuſtice draweth it vp, and vpon what face ſoeuer it droppeth, it maketh it amiable in Gods eye. For this water hath thy heart bene long a limbecke,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:178"/> ſometimes diſtilling it out of the weedes of thy owne offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the fire of true contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sometimes out of the flowers of ſpirituall comforts, with the flames of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and now out of the bitter hearbes of thy maiſters miſeries, with the heat of a tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. This water hath better graced thy lookes, than thy former alluring glances. It hath ſetled worthier beauties in thy face, than all thy artificiall pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Yea this onely water hath quenched Gods anger, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his iuſtice, recouered his mercy, merited his loue purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his pardon, and brought forth the ſpring of all thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. Thy teares were the procters for thy brothers life, the inuiters of thoſe Angels for thy comfort, and the ſuters that ſhall be rewarded with the firſt ſight of thy reuiued Sauiour. Rewarded they ſhall be, but not
<pb facs="tcp:18234:178"/> refrained, altered in their cauſe, but their courſe continued. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen would weepe at the loſſe of ſo precious a water, and earth lament the abſence of ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhowers. No, no, the Angels muſt ſtill bath themſelues in the pure ſtreames of thine eyes, and thy face ſhall ſtill be ſet with this liquid pearle, that as out of thy teares, were ſtroken the firſt ſparkes of thy Lords loue, ſo thy teares may be the oyle to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and feede his fame. Till death dam vp the ſprings, they ſhall neuer ceaſſe running: and then ſhall thy ſoule be ferried in them to the harbour of life, that as by them it was firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from ſinne to grace, ſo in them it may be waſted from grace to glorie. In the meane time reare vp thy fallen hopes, and gather confidence both of thy ſpeedy comfort, and thy Lords well being</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ieſus ſaith vnto her, Marie,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:179"/> She turning, ſaith vnto him: Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boni.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O louing maiſter, thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt onely deferre her conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to increaſe it, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of thy preſence, might be ſo much the more welcome, in that through thy long abſence it was with ſo little hope ſo much deſired. Thou wert con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhe ſhould lay out for thee ſo many ſighes, teares and plaints, and diddeſt purpoſely adiourne the date of her pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to requite the length of theſe delayes, with a larger loane of ioy. It may be ſhe knew not her former happineſſe, till ſhe was weaned from it: nor had a right eſtimate in valuing the treaſures with which thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence did inrich her, vntill her extreame pouertie taught her their vneſtimable rate. But now thou ſheweſt by a ſweete expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that though ſhe payde thee with the deareſt water of
<pb facs="tcp:18234:179"/> her eyes, with her beſt breath, and tendereſt loue, yet ſmall was the price that ſhe beſtowed in reſpect of the worth ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. She ſought thee dead, and impriſoned in a ſtonie gayle, and now ſhe findeth thee both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and at full libertie. She ſought thee ſhrined in a ſhrowd, more like a leaper than thy ſelfe, left as the modell of the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt miſerie, and the onely pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of the bittereſt vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and now ſhe findeth thee inueſted in the robes of glorie, the preſident of the higheſt, and both the owner and giuer of all felicitie.</p>
                  <p>And as all this while ſhe hath ſought without finding, wept without comfort, and called without anſwers: ſo now thou diddeſt ſatisfie her ſeeking with thy comming, her teares with thy triumph, and all her cryes with this one word, <hi>Mary.</hi> For when ſhe heard thee call her in
<pb facs="tcp:18234:180"/> thy wonted manner, and with thy vſuall voice, her onely name iſſuing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy mouth, wrought ſo ſtrange an alteration in her, as if ſhe had bene wholly new made when ſhe was onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For whereas before the violence of her griefe had ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed her, that her body ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med but the hearſe of her dead heart, and the coffin of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing ſoule, and her whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence but a repreſentation of a double funerall, of thine and of her owne: now with this one word her ſenſes are reſtored, her minde lightened, her heart quickened, and her ſoule reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
                  <p>But what maruell though with one word he raiſe the dead ſpirits of his poore Diſciple, that with a word made the world, and euen in this verie word ſheweth an omnipotent power?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mary</hi> ſhe was called as well
<pb facs="tcp:18234:180"/> in her bad as in her reformed eſtate, and both her good and euill, was all of <hi>Maries</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. And as <hi>Marie</hi> ſignifieth no leſſe what ſhe was, than what ſhe is: ſo is this one word, by his vertue that ſpeaketh it, a repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all her miſeries, an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of his mercies, and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of all her better fortunes. And therefore it layd ſo generall a diſcouerie of her ſelfe before her eyes, that it awaked her moſt forgotten ſorrowes, and muſtered together the whole multitude of her ioyes, and would haue left the iſſue of their mutinie very doubtfull, but that the preſence and notice of her higheſt happineſſe decided the quarrell, and gaue her ioyes the victory.</p>
                  <p>For as he was her onely Sunne, whoſe going downe left nothing but a dumpiſh night of fearefull fanſies, wherein no ſtarre of hope ſhined, and the
<pb facs="tcp:18234:181"/> brighteſt planets were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into diſmall ſignes: ſo the ſerenity of his countenance, and authority of his word, brought a calme and well tempered day, that chaſing away all darkneſſe, and diſpercing the clouds of melancholy, cured the lethargy and brake the dead ſleepe of her aſtonied ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>She therefore rauiſhed with his voice, and impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, taketh his talke out of his mouth, and to his firſt and yet onely word anſwered but one other, calling him <hi>Rabboni,</hi> that is, Maiſter. And then ſuddaine ioy rowſing all other paſſions, ſhe could no more proceede in her owne, than giue him leaue to go forward with his ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Loue would haue ſpoken, but feare enforced ſilence. Hope frameth the words, but doubt melteth them in the paſſage: and when her inward conceites ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to come out, her voice
<pb facs="tcp:18234:181"/> trembled, her tongue faltered, her breath failed. In fine, teares iſſued in liew of words, and deepe ſighes in ſtead of long ſentences, the eyes ſupplying the tongues default, and the heart preſſing out the vnſillabled breath at once, which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of her diſagreeing paſſions would not ſuffer to be ſorted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſeuerall ſounds of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p>For ſuch is their eſtate that are ſicke with a ſurfet of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ioy, for the attaining of a thing vehemently deſired. For as deſire is euer vſhered by hope, and wayted on by feare, ſo is it credulous in entertaining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures, but hard in gronnding a firme beleefe. And though it be apt to admit the leaſt ſhadow of wiſhed comfort, yet the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deſire is to haue it, the more perfect aſſurance it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for it: which ſo long as it wanteth the firſt newes or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence
<pb facs="tcp:18234:182"/> of that which is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, is rather an alarum to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vp all paſſions, than retreit to quiet the deſire. For as hope preſumeth the beſt, and inuiteth ioy to gratulate the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: ſo feare ſuſpecteth it too good to be true, and calleth vp ſorrow to bewaile the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie. And while theſe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change obiections and anſwers, ſometimes feare falleth into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, and hope riſeth into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining anger; and thus the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſtil continueth, til euidence of proofe conclude the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marie</hi> therefore though ſhe ſuddainly anſwered vpon notice of his voice, yet becauſe the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie was ſo ſtrange, his perſon ſo changed, his preſence ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, and ſo many miracles layd at once before her amazed eyes, ſhe found a ſedition in her thoughts; til more earneſt viewing him exempted them
<pb facs="tcp:18234:182"/> from all doubt.</p>
                  <p>And then though words would haue broken out, and her heart ſent into his duties that ſhe ought him, yea, euery thought ſtriuing to be firſt vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to haue the firſt roome in his gracious hearing, ſhe was forced as an indifferent arbitrer among them, to ſeale them vp all vnder ſilence by ſuppreſſing ſpeech, and to ſupply the want of words, with more ſignificant actions. And therefore running to the haunt of her chiefeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and falling at his ſacred feete, ſhe offered to bath them with teares of ioy, and to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her lippes with kiſſing his once grieuous but now moſt glorious wounds.</p>
                  <p>She ſtayed not for any more words, being now made bleſſed with the Word himſelfe, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a greater benefit at once to feede all her wiſhes, in the homage, honour, and embracing
<pb facs="tcp:18234:183"/> of his feete, then in the often hearing of his leſſe comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table talke.</p>
                  <p>For as the nature of loue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteth not onely to be vnited, but if it were poſſible wholly transformed out of it ſelfe into the thing it loueth: ſo doth it moſt affect that which moſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteth, and preferreth the leaſt coniunction before any diſtant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment. And therfore to ſee him did not ſuffice her; to heare him did not quiet her; to ſpeake with him was not enough for her; and except ſhe might touch him, nothing could pleaſe her. But though ſhe humbly fell downe at his feete to kiſſe them, yet Chriſt did forbid her, ſaying: <hi>Do not touch me, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O <hi>Ieſu,</hi> what myſterie is in this? Being dead in ſinne, ſhe touched thy mortall feete that were to dye for her ſake, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now aliue in grace, may ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:18234:183"/> not touch thy glorious feete, that are no leſſe for her benefit reuiued? She was once admitted to annoint thy head, and is ſhe now vnworthy of acceſſe to thy feete? Doeſt thou now com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand her from that for which thou wert wont to commend her, and by prayſing the deed didſt moue her often to do it? Sith other women ſhall touch thee, why hath ſhe a repulſe? yea ſith ſhe her ſelfe ſhall touch thee hereafter, why is ſhe now re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iected? What meaneſt thou, O Lord, by thus debarring her of ſo deſired a duty? and ſith among all thy Diſciples thou haſt vouchſafed her ſuch a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, as to honour her eyes with thy firſt ſight, and her eares with thy firſt wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt thou the priuiledge of thy firſt embracing? If the multitude of her teares haue won that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour for her eyes, and her lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to heare thee, ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb facs="tcp:18234:184"/> to her eares, why doeſt thou not admit her hands to touch, and her mouth to kiſſe thy holy feete, ſith the one with many plaints, and the other with their readineſſe to all ſeruices, ſeemed to haue earned no leſſe reward? But notwithſtanding all this, thou preuenteſt the effect of her offer, with forbidding her to touch thee, as if thou haddeſt ſaid:</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Mary,</hi> know the difference betweene a glorious and a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body, betweene the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a momentary and of an eternall life. For ſith the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie of the body and the glory both of body and ſoule are the endowments of an heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, and the rights of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, thinke not this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to ſeeme here ordinarie, nor leaue to touch me a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing.</p>
                  <p>It were not ſo great a wonder to ſee the ſtarres fall from their
<pb facs="tcp:18234:184"/> Spheares, and the Sunne forſake Heauen, and to come within the reach of a mortall arme, as for me that am not onely a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, but the Soueraigne of Saints, and the Sunne whoſe beames are the Angels bliſſe, to ſhew my ſelfe viſible to the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims of this world, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play eternall beauties to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible eyes. Though I be not yet aſcended to my Father, I ſhall ſhortly aſcend, and therefore meaſure not thy demeanour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me by the place where I am, but by that which is due vnto me: and then thou wilt rather with reuerence fall down a farre off, than with ſuch fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie preſume to touch me. Doeſt thou not beleeue my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer promiſes? Haſt thou not a conſtant proofe by my preſent words? Are not thine eyes and eares ſufficient teſtimonies, but that thou muſt alſo haue thy hands and face witneſſes of my<pb facs="tcp:18234:185"/> preſence? Touch me not, ô <hi>Mary,</hi> for if I do deceiue thy ſight, or delude thy hearing, I can as eaſily beguile thy hand, and fruſtrate thy feeling. Or if I be true in any one, beleeue me in all, and embrace me firſt in a firme faith, and then thou ſhalt touch me with more worthy hands. It is now neceſſarie to weane thee from the comfort of my externall preſence, that thou mayſt learne to lodge me in the ſecrets of thy heart, and teach thy thoughts to ſupply the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of outward ſenſes. For in this viſible ſhape I am not here long to be ſeene, being ſhortly to aſcend vnto my Father: but what thine eye then ſeeth not, thy heart ſhall feele, and my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parley will find audience in thy inward eare. Yet if thou fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt leſt my aſcending ſhould be ſo ſudden, that if thou doeſt not now take thy leaue of my feete with thy humble kiſſes &amp; louing
<pb facs="tcp:18234:185"/> teares, thou ſhalt neuer find the like oportunitie againe, licence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee that needleſſe ſuſpition. I am not yet aſcended vnto my Father, &amp; for al ſuch duties, there will be a more conuenient time. But now go about that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth more haſt, and run to my brethren &amp; informe them what I ſay, <hi>That I will go before them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Galilee, there ſhall they ſee me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mary</hi> therefore preferring her Lords will before her owne wiſh, yet ſorrie that her will was worthy of no better euent, departed from him like an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie Infant pulled from a full teate, or a thirſtie Hart chaſed from a ſweete fountaine. She iudged her ſelfe but an vnluckie meſſenger of moſt ioyfull ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, being baniſhed from her maiſters preſence, to carrie newes of his reſurrection. Alas (ſaith ſhe) and cannot others be happy without my vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? or cannot their gaines
<pb facs="tcp:18234:186"/> come in, but through my loſſe? Muſt the dawning of their day, be the euening of mine, and my ſoule robbed of ſuch a treaſure to enrich their eares? O my heart returne thou to enioy him: why goeſt thou with me that am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to go from him? In me thou art but in priſon, and in him is thy onely Paradiſe I haue buried thee long enough in former ſorrowes, and yet now when thou wert halfe reuiued, I am conſtrained to carrie thee from the ſpring of life. Alas, go ſeeke to better thy life in ſome more happy breaſt, ſith I, euill deſeruing creature, am nothing different from that I was, but in hauing taken a taſte of the higheſt delight, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and want of it might drowne me in the deepeſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie.</p>
                  <p>Thus dutie leading, and loue with-holding her, ſhe goeth as faſt backward in thought, as
<pb facs="tcp:18234:186"/> forward in pace, readie eftſoones to faint for griefe, but that a firme hope to ſee him againe, did ſupport her weakeneſſe. She often turned towards the Tombe to breathe, deeming the very ayre that came from the place where he ſtood, to haue taken vertue of his preſence, and to haue in it a refreſhing force aboue the courſe of nature. Sometimes ſhe forgetteth her ſelfe, and loue carrieth her in a golden diſtraction, making her to imagine that her Lord is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and then ſhe ſeemeth to demand him queſtions, and to heare his anſwers: ſhe dreameth that his feete are in her folded armes, and that he giueth her ſoule a full repaſt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. But alas when ſhe cometh to herſelfe, and findeth it but an illuſion, ſhe is ſo much the more ſorrie, in that the onely imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being ſo delightfull, ſhe was not worthy to enioy the
<pb facs="tcp:18234:187"/> thing it ſelfe. And when ſhe paſſeth by thoſe places where her Maiſter had bene: O ſtones (ſaith ſhe) how much more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are you than I, moſt wretched caitiffe, ſith to you was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the touch of thoſe bleſſed feete, whereof my euill deſerts haue now made me vnworthy? Alas what crime haue I of late committed, that hath thus cancelled mee out of his good conceit, and eſtranged mee from his accuſtomed curteſie? Had I but a leaſe of his loue for terme of his life? or did my intereſt in his feete ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with his deceaſſe? In them with my teares I writ my firſt ſupplication for mercie, which I pointed with ſighes, folded vp in my haire, and humbly ſealed with the impreſſion of my lips. They were the dores of my firſt entrance into his fauour, by which I was graciouſly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his, heart, and admitted
<pb facs="tcp:18234:187"/> to do homage vnto his head, while it was yet a mortall mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of immortall maieſtie, an earthly ſeat of an heauenly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, containing in man a Gods felicitie.</p>
                  <p>But alas, I muſt be contented to beare a lower ſaile, and to take downe my deſires to farre meaner hopes, ſith former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours are now too high markes for me to ayme at.</p>
                  <p>O mine eyes, why are you ſo ambitious of heauenly honours? He is now too bright a Sunne for ſo weake a ſight: your lookes are limited to meaner light; you are the eyes of a Bat, and not of an Eagle; you muſt humble your ſelues to the twilight of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things, and meaſure your ſights by your ſlender ſubſtance. Gaze not too much vpon the blaze of eternitie, leſt you loſe your ſelues in too much ſelfe delight, and being too curious in ſifting his maieſtie, you be in
<pb facs="tcp:18234:188"/> the end oppreſſed with his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. No, no, ſith I am reiected from his feete, how can I other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſume, but that my want of faith hath diſlodged me out of his heart, and throwne me out of all poſſeſſion of his minde and memorie. Yet why ſhould I ſtoope to ſo baſe a feare? when want of faith was aggrieued with want of all goodneſſe, he diſdained not to accept me for one of his number: and ſhall I now thinke that he will for my faint beleefe ſo rigorouſly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me? And is the ſinceritie of my loue, wherein he hath no partner, of ſo ſlender account, that it may not hope for ſome little ſparke of his wonted mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie? I will not wrong him with ſo vniuſt a ſuſpition, ſith his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing improueth it, his words ouerthrow it, his countenance doth diſſwade it, why then ſhould I ſucke ſo much ſorrow out of ſo vaine a ſurmiſe?</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18234:188"/>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Maries</hi> trauelling fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, making long voyages in this ſhort iourney, and wauering betweene the ioy of her viſion, and the griefe of her deniall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained her in the way, and held her parley with ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes as are incident vnto minds, in which neither hope is full maiſter of the field, nor feare hath receiued an vtter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow.

Doth her ſorrow ſit ſo neare thy heart, or thy repulſe rebound with ſuch regret by ſeeing her wounded loue bleede ſo faſt at her eyes, that thy late refuſall muſt ſo ſoone be requited with ſo free a graunt? Is it thy pitty, or her change, which cannot allow that ſhe ſhould any longer faſt from her earneſt longing?</p>
                  <p>But ô moſt milde Phiſition, well knoweſt thou that thy ſharp corroſiue with bitter ſmart angred her tender wound, which being rather cauſed by vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ignorance than wilfull er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, was as ſoone cured as knowne. And therefore thou quickely applyeſt a ſweete le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue to aſſwage her paine, that ſhe might acknowledge her forbidding, rather a fatherly checke to her vnſetled faith,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:189"/> than an auſtere reiecting her for her fault: and therefore thou admitteſt her to kiſſe thy feete, the two conduits of grace, and ſeales of our redemption, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her a Charter of thy vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged loue, and accepting of her the vowed ſacrifice of her ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſoule.</p>
                  <p>And thus gracious Lord haſt thou finiſhed her ſeares, aſſured her hopes, fulfilled her deſires, ſatisfied her loues, ſtinted her teares, perfected her ioyes, and made the period of her expiring griefes, the preamble to her now entring, and neuer ending pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>O how mercifull a Father thou art to left Orphanes, how eaſie a Iudge to repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and how faithfull a friend to ſincere louers! It is vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly true, that thou neuer lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt thoſe that loue thee, and thou loueſt ſuch as reſt their affiance in thee. They ſhall finde
<pb facs="tcp:18234:190"/> thee liberall aboue deſert, and bountifull beyond hope: a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thy gifts, not by their merits but thine owne mercie.</p>
                  <p>O Chriſtian ſoule, take <hi>Mary</hi> for thy mirrour, follow her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that like effects may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thine. Learne ô ſinfull man of this once a ſinfull woman; that ſinners may finde Chriſt if their ſinnes be amended. Learne that whom ſinne loſeth, loue recouereth, whom faintneſſe of faith chaſeth away, firmneſſe of hope recalleth; and that which no other mortall force, fauour or pollicie can compaſſe, the continued teares of a conſtant loue are able to attaine. Learne of <hi>Mary,</hi> for Chriſt to feare no encounters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of Chriſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no comforts, and with the loue of Chriſt to ouer-rule the loue of all things R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſe early in the morning of thy good mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions, and let them not ſleepe in ſloth, when diligence may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb facs="tcp:18234:190"/> them. Runne with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to thy ſinfull heart which ſhould haue bene the Temple, but through thy fault was no better than a Tombe for Chriſt, ſith hauing in thee no life to feele him, he ſeemed vnto thee as if he had bene dead. Role away the ſtone of thy former hardneſſe, remoue all thy heauy loads that oppreſſe thee in ſinne, and looke into thy ſoule, whether thou canſt there find the Lord. If he be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, ſtand weeping without, and ſeeke him in other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſith being preſent in all, he may be found in any. Let faith be thine eye hope thy guide, and loue thy light. Seeke him and not his: for himſelfe, and not for his gifts. If thy faith haue found him in a cloud, let thy hope ſeeke to him. If hope haue led thee to ſee him, let loue ſeek further into him. To moue in thee a deſire to finde, his goods
<pb facs="tcp:18234:191"/> are precious: and when he is found, to keepe thee in a deſire to ſeeke, his treaſures are infinit. Abſent, he muſt be ſought to be had; being had, he muſt be ſought to be more enioyed. Seeke him truly, and no other for him. Seeke him purely, and no other thing with him. Seeke him onely, and nothing beſides him. And if at the firſt ſearch he appeare not, thinke it not much to perſeuer in teares, and to continue thy ſeeking. Stand vpon the earth, trending vnder thee all earthly vanities, and touching them with no more than the ſoles of thy feete, that is with the loweſt and leaſt part of thy affection. To looke the better in the Tombe, bow downe thy neeke to the yoke of humilitie, and ſtoupe from loftie and proude conceits, that with humbled and lowly lookes thou mayeſt finde whom ſwelling and haughtie thoughts haue driuen
<pb facs="tcp:18234:191"/> away. A ſubmitted ſoule ſooneſt winneth his returne, and the deeper it ſinketh in a ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, the higher it climeth in his higheſt fauours. And if thou perceiueſt in the Tombe of thy heart the preſence of his two firſt Meſſengers, that is, at the feete, ſorrow for the bad that is paſt, and at the head deſire to a better that is to come, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them with ſighes, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them with penitent teares: yet reckoning them but as her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers of thy Lord, ceaſſe not thy ſeeking till thou findeſt himſelfe. And if he vouchſafe thee his glorious ſight, offering himſelfe to thy inward eyes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not of thy ſelfe to be able to know him, but as his vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſuppliant proſtrate thy peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thou maiſt truely diſcerne him, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerue him. Thus preparing thee with diligence, comming with ſpeed, ſtanding with high
<pb facs="tcp:18234:192"/> lifted hopes, and ſtooping with inclined heart, if with <hi>Mary</hi> thou craueſt no other ſolace of <hi>Ieſus</hi> but <hi>Ieſus</hi> himſelfe, he will anſwere thy teares with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and aſſure thee of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with his owne words, that hauing ſeene him thy ſelfe, thou maieſt make him knowne to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: ſaying with <hi>Mary, I haue ſeene our Lord, and theſe things he ſaid vnto me.</hi>

I intended this comfort to him whom a lamenting ſort hath left moſt comfortleſſe, by him to his friends, who haue equall portions in this ſorrow. But I think the Philoſophers rule will be heere verified, that it ſhall be laſt in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, which was firſt deſigned, and

Thus let Chance be our rule ſince Choice may not, and into which of your hands it ſhall fortune, much honour and happineſſe may it carry with it, and leaue in their hearts as much ioy, as it found ſorrow. Where I borrow the perſon of an Hiſtorie, as well touching the dead, as the yet ſuruiuing, I build vpon report of of ſuch Authours, whoſe hoarie heades challenge credit, and whoſe eyes and eares were witneſſes of their words. To craue pardon for my paine were to ſlander a friendly office, and to wrong their curteſies, whom Nobilitie neuer taught to anſwer affection with anger, or to wage dutie with diſlike: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly preſent vnto them with as many good wiſhes, as good will can meaſure from the beſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mind, that hath a willingneſſe rather to offoord, then to offer due ſeruice, were not the meane as worthleſſe as the mind is willing.</p>

I doubt not, but that Spirit, whoſe nature is Loue, and whoſe name Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, as he knowes the cauſe of our griefe, ſo hath he ſalued it with ſupplies of grace, powring into your wound no leſſe oyle of mercy then wine of iuſtice;
<pb facs="tcp:18234:197"/> yet ſith courteſie oweth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion as a dutie to the afflicted, and nature hath ingrafted a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to finde it, I thought good to ſhew you by proofe, that you carry not your cares alone, though the loade that lieth on others can little lighten your burthen: her deceaſſe can not but ſit nearer your heart, whom you had taken ſo deepe into a moſt tender affection. That which dieth to our loue, being alwayes aliue to our ſorrow, you would haue bene kind to a leſſe louing ſiſter: yet finding in her ſo many worths to be loued, your loue wrought more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly vpon ſo ſweete a ſubiect, which now being taken from you, I preſume your griefe is no leſſe then your loue was; the one of theſe being euer the meaſure of the other: the Scripture mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to bring forth our teares on the dead, a thing not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding grace, and a right to reaſon.
<pb facs="tcp:18234:197"/> For to be without remorſe in the death of friends, is neither incident nor conuenient to the nature of man, hauing too much affinitie to a ſauage temper, and ouerthrowing the ground of all piety, which is a mutuall ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie in each of others miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: but as not to feele ſorrow in ſorrowfull chances, is to want ſenſe, ſo, not to beare it with moderation, is to want vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the one brutiſh, the other effeminate: and he hath caſt his account beſt, that hath brought his ſumme to the meane. It is no leſſe fault to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in ſorrow, then to paſſe the limits of competent mirth, ſith exceſſe in either is a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in paſſion, though that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of curteſie be leſſe blamed of men, becauſe, if it be a fault, it is alſo a puniſhment, at once cauſing and taſting torments. It is no good ſigne in the ſicke to be ſenſleſſe in his paines, as bad
<pb facs="tcp:18234:198"/> it is to be vnuſually ſenſitiue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both either herbingers or attendants of death. Let ſadnes, ſith it is a due to the dead, teſtifie a feeling of pitty, not any pang of paſſion, and bewray rather a tender then a deiected minde. Mourne, as that your friends may finde you a liuing brother, all men a diſcreet mourner, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſorrow a ſignell, not a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour of reaſon: ſome are ſo obſtinate in their owne will, that euen time the naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of the moſt violent ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, cannot by any delayes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage their griefe: they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their ſorrow with ſolitary muſes, and feede their ſighes and teares; they pine their bodies, and draw all penſiue conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their minds, nurſing their heauineſſe with a melancholy humour, as though they had vowed themſelues to ſadneſſe, vnwilling it ſhould end till it had ended them, wherein their
<pb facs="tcp:18234:198"/> folly ſometimes findeth a ready effect; that being true which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> obſerued,<note place="margin">Pro 1.25</note> that as a moath the garment, and a worme the wood, ſo doth ſadneſſe perſwade the heart. But this impotent ſoftnes fitteth not ſober mindes. We muſt not make a liues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a ſeuen nights duety, nor vnder colour of kindneſſe to other; be vnnaturall to our ſelues: if ſome in their paſſion ioyned their thoughts into ſuch labyrinths, that neither wit knoweth, nor will careth how long, or how farre they wander in them, it diſcouereth their weakeneſſe, but diſcerneth our meditation. It is (for the moſt) the fault, not of all, but of the ſillieſt women, who next to the funerall of their friends, deeme it a ſecond widowhood, to force their teares, and make it their happineſſe, to ſeeme moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, as though they had onely bene left aliue, to be a perpetuall
<pb facs="tcp:18234:199"/> map of dead folkes misfortunes: but this is, to arme an enemie againſt our ſelues, and to yeeld Reaſon priſoner to Paſſion, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſword in the rebelles hand, when we are leaſt able to withſtand his treaſon. Sorrow once ſetled, is not lightly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, eaſily winning, but not ſo eaſily ſurrendring poſſeſſion; and where it is not excluded in time, it challengeth a place by preſcription. The Scripture war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs, not to giue our hearts to ſadneſſe, yea rather, to reiect it as a thing not beneficiall to the dead, yea preiudiciall to our ſelues;<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> alloweth but ſeuen dayes to mourning, iudging moderation in plaint to be a ſufficient teſtimony in good will, and a needefull office of wiſedome. Much ſorrow for the dead, is either the child of ſelfe-loue, or of raſh iudgement. If we ſhould ſhead our teares for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, as a meane to our
<pb facs="tcp:18234:199"/> contentment, we ſhew but our owne wound perfit louers of our ſelues: if we lament their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſe as their hard deſtinie, we attache them of euill deſeruing, with too peremtory a cenſure, as though their life had bene an ariſe, and their death a leape in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmall perdition; for otherwiſe a good departure craueth ſmall condoling, being but a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour from ſtormes, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance vnto felicitie. But you know your ſiſter too well to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre any blame in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. And experience of her life hath ſtored your thoughts with notice of ſo rare vertues, as might ſooner make her memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie all enforcement to ioy, then any inducement to ſorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moue you to eſteeme her laſt duties, rather the triumph of her victory, then the farewels of her deceaſſe. She was by birth, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to none, but vnto the firſt in the realme, yet ſhe meaſured
<pb facs="tcp:18234:200"/> onely greatneſſe by goodneſſe, making Nobilitie but the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of vertue; as able to ſhew things worthy to be ſeene, as apte to draw many eyes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde it, ſhe ſuted her behauiour to her birth, and enobled her birth with her piety, leauing her houſe more beholding to her for hauing honored it with the glorie of her vertues, then ſhe was to it for the titles of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. She was high minded in nothing, but in aſpiring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and in the diſdaine of vice; in other things couering her greatneſſe with humilitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong her inferiors, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with curteſie among her peeres.

<pb facs="tcp:18234:200"/> ſhe hauing alwaies armed it with ſuch modeſtie as taught the moſt vntemperate tongues to be ſilent in her preſence, and anſwered their eyes with ſcorne and contempt, that did but ſeeme to make her an ayme to paſſion; yea, and in this behalfe, as almoſt in all orhers, ſhe hath the moſt honorable &amp; knowen Ladies of the land, ſo common and knowen witneſſes, that thoſe that leaſt loued her reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, were in loue with her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, deliuering their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in open prayſes. How mildly ſhe accepted the checke of fortune fallen vpon her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſert, experience hath bene a moſt manifeſt proofe, the temper of her mind being ſo eaſie, that ſhe found little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie in taking downe her thoughts to a meane degree, which true honour, not pride hath raiſed to the former height. Her faithfulneſſe &amp; loue where
<pb facs="tcp:18234:201"/> ſhe fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d true friendſhip, is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with teares in many eyes, and will be longer regiſtred in gratefull memories of diuers that haue tried her in that kind, auowing her for ſecrecie, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and conſtancie, to be a miracle in that ſexe: yea when ſhe found leaſt kindneſſe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhe neuer loſt it in her ſelfe, more willingly ſuffering then offering wrong, and often weeping for their miſhaps, whom though leſſe louing her, ſhe could not but affect. Of the innocencie of her life, this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall each one can auerre, that as ſhe was gratefull many wayes, and memorable for vertues, ſo was ſhe free from all blemiſh of any vice, vſing, to her power, the beſt meanes to keepe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally an vndefiled conſcience: her attire was euer ſuch as might both ſatisfie a curious eye, and yet beare witneſſe of a ſober minde, neither ſingular, nor
<pb facs="tcp:18234:201"/> vaine, but ſuch as her peeres of beſt report vſed: her tongue was very little acquainted with oathes, vnleſſe either duty or diſtruſt did enforce them: and ſurely they were needeleſſe to thoſe that knew her, to whom the truth of her words could not iuſtly be ſuſpected; much leſſe was ſhe noted of any vnfitting talke, which as it was euer hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to her eares, ſo did it neuer defile her breath. Of feeding ſhe was very meaſureable, rather too ſparing, than too liberall a diet: ſo religious for obſeruing of faſts, that neuer in her ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhe could hardly be wonne to breake them: and if our ſoules be poſſeſſed in our patience, ſurely her ſoule was truely her owne, whoſe rocke though often ſtricken with the rod of aduerſity. neuer yeelded any more then to giue iſſue of eye ſtreames: and though theſe through the tenderneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:18234:202"/> of her nature, and aptneſſe of her ſexe, were the cuſtomarie tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes that her loue payed, more to her friends then her owne misfortunes, yet were they not accompanied with diſtempered words, or ill ſeeming actions, reaſon neuer forgetting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, though remembring pity. Her deuotions ſhe daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, offering the daily ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an innocent heart, and ſtinting her felfe to her times of prayer, which ſhe performed with ſo religious a care, as well ſhewed that ſhe knew how high a Maieſtie ſhe ſerued. I neede not write how dutifully ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all the behoofes of a moſt louing wife, ſince that was the commoneſt theame of her praiſe: yet this may be ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out improofe to any, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in this behalfe may be counted her equall, none can iuſtly be thought her ſuperiour. Where ſhe owed, ſhe paied du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:202"/> where ſhe found ſhe returned curteſie; whereſoeuer ſhe was knowen, ſhe deſerued amitie; deſirous of the beſt, yet diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning none but euill companie: ſhe was readier to requite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits then reuenge wrongs, more grieued then angrie with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe of friends, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſtaking or miſreport oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned any breaches: for if their words carry credite, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred deepeſt into her thoughts, they haue acquitted her from all ſpice of malice, not onely againſt her friends, whoſe diſlikes were but a retire to ſlip further into friendſhip, but euen her greateſt enemies, to whom if ſhe had bene a iudge as ſhe was a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I aſſuredly thinke ſhe would haue redreſſed, but not reuenged her wrongs In ſumme, ſhe was an honour to her prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, a light to her age, and a patterne to her poſteritie; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was her concluſion diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb facs="tcp:18234:203"/> from her premiſes, or her death from her life, ſhe ſhewed no diſmay, being warned of her danger, carrying in her conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the ſafe conduct of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie. But hauing ſent her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to heauen before with a milde countenance, and a moſt calme minde, in more hope then feare, ſhe expected her owne paſſage, ſhe commended both her duty and good will to all her friends, and cleared her heart from all grudge towards her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, wiſhing true happineſſe to them both, as beſt became ſo ſoft and gentle a mind, in which anger neuer ſtayed, but as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome ſtranger: She made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen profeſſion that ſhe did die true to her religion, true to her husband, true to God and the world: ſhe enioyed her iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as long as ſhe breathed, her body earneſtly offering her laſt deuotions, ſupplying in thought what faintneſſe ſuffered
<pb facs="tcp:18234:203"/> not her tongue to vtter: in the end, when her glaſſe was runne out, and death began to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge his intereſt, ſome labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with too late remedies to hinder the deliuery of her ſweet ſoule, ſhe deſired them eftſoones to let her go to God; and her hopes calling her to eternall kingdomes, as one rather fallen aſleepe, then dyieg, ſhe moſt happily tooke her leaue of all mortall miſeries. Such was the life, ſuch was the death of your deareſt ſiſter, both ſo full of true comfort, that this ſurely of her vertues may be a ſufficient leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to your bittereſt griefes. For you are not (I hope) in the number of thoſe that reckon it a part of their paine to heare of their beſt remedies, thinking the rehearſall of your dead friends praiſes an vpbraiding of their loſſe: but ſith the obliuion of her vertuues were iniurious to her, let not the mention of
<pb facs="tcp:18234:204"/> her perſon be offenſiue vnto you, and be not you grieued with her death, with which ſhe is beſt pleaſed. So bleſſed a death is rather to be wiſhed of vs, then pitied in her, whoſe ſoule tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth with God, whoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſtill breatheth in the mouths of infinite praiſes and liueth in the memories of all, to whom either experience made her knowne, or fame was not enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to conceale her deſerts. She was a iewell, that both God and you deſired to enioy; he to her aſſured benefit without ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, you for allowable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, yet employing her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint among certaine hazards and moſt vncertaine hopes. Be then vmpire in your owne cauſe, whether your wiſhes or Gods will importeth more loue, the one, the adornement of her exile, the other, her returne into a moſt bleſſed countrey. And ſith it pleaſed God in this loue to be
<pb facs="tcp:18234:204"/> your riuall, let your diſcretion decide the doubt, whom in due ſhould carry the ſuite, the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue being but a right to the one: for nature and grace being the motiues of both your loues, ſhe had the beſt litle in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that was authour of them: and ſhe, if worthy to be beloued of either, as ſhe was of both, could not but preferre him to the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt portion of her deepeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: let him with good leaue gather the grape of his owne vine, and plucke the fruite of his owne planting, and thinke ſo curious workes euer ſafeſt in the artificers hand, who is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt to loue them, and beſt able to preſerue them. She did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her duty in dying willingly: and if you will do yours, you muſt be willing with her death, ſith to repine at her liking, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteſie at Gods, an impiety, both vnfitting for your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vertue; ſhe being in place
<pb facs="tcp:18234:205"/> where no griefe can annoy her, ſhe hath little neede, or leſſe ioy of your ſorrow; neither can ſhe allow in her friends, that ſhe would loathe in her ſelfe, loue neuer affecting likeneſſe: if ſhe had bene euill, ſhe had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued our teares: being good, ſhe cannot deſire them, nothing being leſſe to the likeneſſe of goodneſſe; than to ſee it ſelfe any cauſe of vniuſt diſquiet or trouble to the innocent. Would <hi>Saul</hi> haue thought it friendſhip, to haue wept for his fortune, in hauing found a kingdome,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 17.</note> by ſeeking of cattell? or <hi>Dauid</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a curteſie, to haue ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed at his ſucceſſe, that from following ſheepe, came to foyle a giant, and to receiue in fine, a royall crowne for his victorie? why then ſhould her lot be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, whom higher fauour hath raiſed from the duſt to ſit with princes of Gods people,<note place="margin">Pſal. 112</note> if ſecurity had bene giuen, that
<pb facs="tcp:18234:205"/> a longer life ſhould ſtill haue bene guided by vertue, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with good fortune, you might pretend ſome cauſe to complaine of her deceaſſe. But if different effects ſhould haue croſſed your hopes (proceſſe of time being the parent of ſtrange alterations) then had death bene friendlier then your ſelfe: and ſith it hung in ſuſpence which of the two would haue happened, let vs allow God ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, as to thinke him the fitteſt arbitrator in deciſion of the doubt: her foundations of happineſſe were in the holy hills,<note place="margin">Pſal 86.</note> and God ſawe it fitteſt for her building to be but low in the vale of teares: &amp; better it was it ſhould be ſoone taken downe, then by riſing too high, to haue oppreſſed her ſoule with the ruines. Thinke it no iniurie that ſhe is now taken from you, but a fauour, that ſhe was lent you ſo long, and ſhew no vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:18234:206"/> to reſtore God his owne, ſith hitherto you haue payed no vſurie for it. Conſider not how much longer you might haue enioyed her, but how much ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you might haue loſt her: and ſith ſhe was held vpon cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, not by any couenant, take our ſoueraigne right for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon of her death; our life is but lent; a good, to make thereof during the loane, our beſt commodity. It is due debt to a more certaine owner than our ſelues, and therefore ſo long as we haue it, we receiue a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, when we are depriued of it, we haue no wrong: we are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants at will of this clayie farme, not for tearme of yeares; when we are warned out, we muſt be ready to remoue, hauing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther title but the owners plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: it is but an Inne, not an home: we came but to baite, not to dwell, and the condition of our entrance was in fine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
<pb facs="tcp:18234:206"/> If this departure be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, it is alſo common, this to day to me, to morrow to thee; and the caſe equally afflicting all, leaues none any cauſe to complaine of iniurious vſage.</p>
                  <p>Natures debt is ſooner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of ſome than of other, yet is there no fault in the creditor that exacteth but his owne, but in the greedineſſe of our eager hopes, either repining that their wiſhes faile, or willingly forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their mortalitie, whom they are vnwilling by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſee mortall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall tide wafteth all paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the ſame ſhore, ſome ſooner, ſome later, but all at the laſt: and we muſt ſettle our minds, to take our courſe as it commeth, neuer fearing a thing ſo neceſſary, yet euer expecting a thing ſo vncertaine. It ſeemeth that God purpoſely concealed the time of our death, leauing vs reſolued betweene feare and
<pb facs="tcp:18234:207"/> hope of longer continuance. Cut off vnripe cares, leſt with the notice and penſiueneſſe of our diuorce from the world, we ſhould loſe the comfort of needfull contentments, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our dying day, languiſh away with expectation of death. Some are taken in their firſt ſteppe into this life, receiuing in one, their welcome and fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, as though they had bene borne, onely to be buried, and to take their paſport in this hourely middle of their courſe; the good, to preuent change, the bad, to ſhorten their impietie. Some liue till they be weary of life, to giue proofe of their good hap, that had a kindlier paſſage, yet though the date be diuers, the debt is all one, equally to be anſwered of all as their time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pireth:<note place="margin">Pſal. 88.</note> for who is the man ſhall liue and not ſee death? ſith we all dye, and like water ſlide vpon the earth. In Paradice we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:18234:207"/> the ſentence of Death,<note place="margin">Gen. 5.</note> and here, as priſoners, we are kept in ward, tarying but our times till the Gaoler call vs to our execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whom hath any vertue eternized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or deſert commended to poſterity, that hath not mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in life, and bene mourned after death, no aſſurance of ioy being ſealed without ſome teares? Euen the bleſſed Virgin the mother of God, was thrown downe as deepe in temporall miſeries, as ſhe was aduanced high in ſpirituall honours, none amongſt all mortall creatures finding in life more proofe then ſhe of her mortalitie. For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the nobleſt ſonne that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer woman was mother of, not onely aboue the condition of men, but aboue the glorie of Angels, being her ſonne onely, without temporall Father, and thereby the loue of both parents doubled in her breaſt, being her onely Sonne without other
<pb facs="tcp:18234:208"/> iſſue, and ſo her loue of all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren finiſhed in him. Yea, he being God, and ſhe the neareſt creature to Gods perfections, yet no prerogatiue, either quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her from mourning, or him from dying: and though they ſurmounted the higheſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in all other preheminences, yet were they equall with the meaneſt men in the ſentence of Death. And howbeit the bleſſed Virgine being the patterne of Chriſtian mourners, ſo tempered her anguiſh, that there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing vndone that might be exacted of a mother, nor any thing done that might be miſliked in ſo perfect a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron; yet by this we may gheſſe with what curteſies death is likely to friend vs, that durſt cauſe ſo bloudy funerals in ſo heauenly a ſtocke, not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him from the law of dying, that was the authour of life, and ſoone after to honour his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
<pb facs="tcp:18234:208"/> with ruines and ſpoile of death. Seeing therefore that Death ſpareth none, let vs ſpare our teares for better vſes, being but an idoll ſacrifice to this deafe and implacable executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And for this, not long to be continued, where they can neuer profit, Nature did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vs a weeping life, exacting teares for cuſtome at our firſt entrance, and for ſuting our whole courſe in this dolefull beginning. Therefore they muſt be vſed with meaſure, that muſt be vſed ſo often: and ſo many cauſes of weeping lying yet in the debt, ſith we cannot end our teares, let vs at the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them: if ſorrow cannot be ſhunned, let it be taken in time of neede, ſith otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both troubleſome and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, it is a double miſerie, or an open folly. We moiſten not the ground with precious waters, they were ſtilled to nobler ends,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:209"/> either by their fruits to delight our ſenſes, or by their operation, to preſerue our healths. Our teares are water of too high a price to be prodigally powred in the duſt of any graues. If they be teares of loue, they perfume our prayers, making them odour of ſweetneſſe, fit to be offered on the Altar before the throne of God: if teares of contrition, they are water of life to the dying and corrupting ſoules,<note place="margin">Apoc. 8.</note> they may purchaſe fauour, and repeale the ſentence till it be executed,<note place="margin">3 King. 26.</note> as the example of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi> doth teſtifie, but when the puniſhment is paſt, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict performed in effect, their pleading is in vaine,<note place="margin">2 Kin 8.11.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> taught vs when his child was dead, ſaying, that he was likelier to go to it, than it, by his wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, to returne to him. Learne therefore to giue ſorrow no long dominion ouer you. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wiſe ſhould rather
<pb facs="tcp:18234:209"/> marke, than expect an end. Meet it not when it commeth, do not inuite it when it is abſent: when you feele it, do not force it, ſith the bruite creatures, which (Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeldome erring in her courſe, guideth in the meane) haue but a ſhort, though vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſenſe of their loſſes. You ſhould bury the ſharpneſſe of your griefe, with the courſe, and reſt contented with a kind, yet a milde compaſſion, neither leſſe than decent for you, nor more than agreeable to your nature &amp; iudgement. Your much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe would renew a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of griefes, and your eyes would be ſprings to many ſtreames, adding to the memory of the dead, a new occaſion of plaint by your owne diſcomfort. The motion of your heart mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth the beating of many pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which in any diſtemper of your quiet with the like ſtroke will ſoone bewray themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:18234:210"/> ſicke of your diſeaſe: your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune though hard, yet is it noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and though moued in miſhap, and ſet in an vnworthy lanterne, yet your owne light ſhineth farre, and maketh you markeable: euery one will bend an attentiue eye vpon you, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing how you ward this blow of temptation, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your patience be a ſhield of proofe, or eaſily entred with theſe violent ſtrokes. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly expected, that ſo high thoughts which haue already climed ouer the hardeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſhould not now ſtoupe to any vulgar or female com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Great perſonages, whoſe eſtate draweth vpon them many eyes, as they cannot but be themſelues, ſo may not they vſe the libertie of meaner eſtates, the lawes of Nobilitie not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them to direct their deeds by their deſires, but to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their deſires to that which
<pb facs="tcp:18234:210"/> is decent.</p>
                  <p>Nobility is an ayme for lower degrees to leuell at markes of higher perfection, and like ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly windowes in the Northeaſt roomes of politicke and ciuill buildings, to let in ſuch light, and lie open to ſuch proſpects, as may affoord their inferiours both to finde meanes and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Heroicall vertues. If you ſhould determine to dwell euer in ſorrow, it were a wrong to your wiſedome, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by your qualitie. If euer you mind to ſurceaſſe it, no time fitter than the preſent, ſith the ſame reaſons that hereafter might moue you, are now as much in force. Yeld to Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that which you muſt yeeld to Time: be beholding to your ſelfe, not to Time for the victory; make it a voluntary worke of diſcretion that will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be a neceſſary worke of delay. We thinke it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb facs="tcp:18234:211"/> to haue our owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure brim full with euill, vnleſſe we make it runne ouer with others miſeries, taking their misfortunes as our puniſhments, and executing forreine penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties vpon our ſelues. Yea diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet mindes being euer bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes to their owne flames, miſtake oft times others good for ill, their follie making it a true ſcourge to them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it ſeemed twas to others a benefit. <hi>Iacob</hi> out of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> abſence ſucked ſuch ſurmiſes, as he made his heart a prey to his agonies, whereas that that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him in his owne melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, raiſed <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to his higheſt happineſſe. If <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſaid, and ſuppoſed ſhe could haue ſuncke no deeper in griefe, than ſhe had already plunged her ſelfe; and yet, that which ſhe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined the vttermoſt of euils proued in concluſion, the very bliſſe of her wiſhes; the like
<pb facs="tcp:18234:211"/> may be your errour, if you cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your minde with thinking vpon her death, which could neuer be diſcharged from cares, till death ſet his hand to her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance, nor receiue the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an eternall being, till her ſoule were preſented at the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. I loath to rubbe the ſcarre of a deeper wound, for feare of renewing a dead diſcomfort; yet if you will fauour your owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, the maiſterie ouer that griefe that ſprings from the roote, may learne you to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this that buddeth from the branch. Let not her loſſes moue you that are acquainted with greater of your owne, and taught by experience to know how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine then change is for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnconſtant fortune throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the dice. If ſhe want the wonted titles, her part is now ended, and they were due but vpon the ſtage: her loſſe therein is but a wracke of wounds, in
<pb facs="tcp:18234:212"/> which ſhe is but euen with the height of Princes, ſurpaſſing both her ſelfe in them, and the new honours of heauenly ſtile. If ſhe haue left her children, it was her wiſh, they ſhould repay her abſence with vſury; yet had ſhe ſent her firſt fruits before her as pledges of her owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. And now may we ſay that the Sparrow hath found an home, and the Turtle doue a neaſt, where ſhe may lay her yonglings, enioying ſome, and expecting the reſt. If ſhe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her friends, ſhe is alſo deliuered from her enemies, in hope hereafter to enioy the firſt, out of feare of euer being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the latter. If ſhe be cut off in her youth, no age is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe for a good death; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ended her taske, though neuer ſo ſhort yet ſhe hath liued out her full time. Old age is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, not long, to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by increaſe of vertues, not by
<pb facs="tcp:18234:212"/> number of yeares: for grauity co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in wiſedom,<note place="margin">Sap. 4.</note> and an vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted life is the ripeneſſe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt age. If ſhe were in poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of preferment, ſhe could hardly haue mounted higher, than from whence ſhe was throwne: hauing bene bruſed with the firſt, ſhe had little will to clime for a ſecond fall. We might hitherto truly haue ſaid, this is that <hi>Naomi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ruth. 1.</note> ſhe being to her end enriched with many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and more inward graces. But, whether hereafter ſhee would haue bid vs not to call her <hi>Naomi,</hi> that is, faire, but <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> that ſignifieth bitter, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, ſith ſhe might haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the widdows felicitie, that ſo changed her name to the likeneſſe of her lot. Inſomuch that ſhe is freed from more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries then ſhe ſuffered loſſes, and more fortunate by not deſiring, then ſhe would be by enioying fortunes fauour; which if it be
<pb facs="tcp:18234:213"/> not counted a follie to loue, yet it is a true happineſſe, not to need: we may rather thinke that Death was prouided againſt her imminent harmes, then enuious of any future proſperities: the times being great with ſo many broyles, that when they once fall in labour, we ſhall thinke their condition ſecureſt whom ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence hath exempted, both from feeling the bitter throwes, and beholding the monſtrous iſſue that they are likely to bring forth. The more you tender her, the more temperate ſhould be your griefe, ſith ſeeing you vpon going, ſhe did but ſtep before you into the next world, to which ſhe thought you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long more than to this, which hath already giuen you the moſt vngratefull congee. They that are vpon remouing, ſend their furniture before them; and you ſtill ſtanding vpon your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what ornament could you
<pb facs="tcp:18234:213"/> rather wiſh in your future abode, then this that did euer pleaſe you? God thither ſendeth your Adamants, whither he would draw your heart, and caſteth your anchors where your thoughts ſhould lie at roade, that ſeeing your loue taken out of the world, and your hopes diſanchored from the ſtormie ſhoare, you might ſettle your deſires where God ſeemeth to require them. If you would haue wiſhed her life for an example to your houſe, aſſure your ſelfe ſhe hath left her friends ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited with her vertues, and ſo perfect patternes of her beſt part, that who knoweth the ſurui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, may ſee the deceaſſed, and ſhall finde little difference, but in the number, which before was greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not better, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were in one repetition of the ſame goodneſſe: wherefore ſet your ſelfe at reſt in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, whoſe works are
<pb facs="tcp:18234:214"/> perfect, and whoſe wiſedome is infinite. The termes of our life are like the ſeaſons of the yeare, ſome for ſowing, ſome for growing, and ſome for reaping; in this onely different, that as the heauens keepe their preſcribed periods, ſo the ſucceſſion of times haue their appointed chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But in the ſeaſons of our life, which are not the law of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie cauſes, ſome are reaped in the ſeed, ſome in the blade, ſome in the vnripe eares, all in the end; this harueſt depending vpon the Reapers will. Death is too ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a thing to ſeeme any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelty, being a familiar gueſt in euery houſe; and ſith his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is expected, and his errand vnknowne, neither his preſence ſhould be feared, nor his effects lamented. What wonder is it to ſee fuell burned, ſpice-pouned, or ſnow melted? And as little feare it is to ſee thoſe dead that were borne vpon condition once
<pb facs="tcp:18234:214"/> to dye. She was ſuch a compound as was once to be reſolued vnto her ſimples, which is now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, her ſoule being giuen to God, and her body reſorted into her firſt elements. It could not diſlike you, to ſee your friend remoued out of a ruinous houſe, &amp; the houſe it ſelf deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pulled down, if you knew it were to build it in a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier forme, and to turne the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant with more ioy into a fairer lodging. Let then your ſiſters ſoule depart without griefe, let her body alſo be altred into duſt: withdraw your eyes from the ruine of this cottage, and caſt them vpon the maieſtie of the ſecond building, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith ſhall be incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, glorious, ſtrange, ſpirituall, and immortall. Night and ſleepe are perpetuall mirrours, figuring in their darkneſſe, ſilence, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of ſenſes, the finall end of our mortall bodies: and for this
<pb facs="tcp:18234:215"/> ſome haue entituled ſleepe the eldeſt brother of Death: but with no leſſe conuenience it might be called one of Deaths tenants, neare vnto him in affinity of condition, yet farre inferiour in right, being but tennant for a time, of that Death is the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: for, by vertue of the conueyance made vnto him in Paradice, that duſt we were, and to duſt we muſt returne; he hath hitherto ſhewed his ſeigniory ouer all, exacting of vs, not onely the yearely, but hourely reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of time, which euer by minuts we defray vnto him: ſo that our very life is not onely a memory, but a part of our death, ſith the longer we haue liued the leſſe we haue to liue. What is the daily leſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

For as in teares, ſo in life, the value is not eſteemed by the length, but by the fruit &amp; goodneſſe, which often is more in the leaſt than in the longeſt. What your ſiſter wanted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, ſhe ſupplyed in ſpeed; and as with her needle ſhe wrought more in a day than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ladies in a yeare, hauing both excellent skill, and no leſſe delight in working: ſo with her diligence, doubling her ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, ſhe wonne more vertue in halfe than others in a whole life. Her death to time was her birth to eternitie, the loſſe of this world an exchange of a better, one endowment that ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:18234:216"/> had being impaired, but many farre greater added to the ſtore. <hi>Mardocheus</hi> houſe was too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure a dwelling for ſo gracious an <hi>Heſter,</hi> ſhrowding royall parts in the mantle of a meane eſtate, and ſhadowing immortall benefits vnder earthly veiles. It was fitter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe being a ſumme of ſo rare perfections, and ſo well worthy a ſpouſe of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <hi>Ahaſhuerus,</hi> ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to his court from her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer abode, there to be inueſted in glorie, and to enioy both place and preheminence anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to her worthineſſe: her loue would haue bene leſſe able to haue borne your death, then your conſtancy to brooke hers, and therefore God mercifully cloſed her eyes before they were puniſhed with ſo grieuous a ſight, taking out to you but a new leſſon of patience out of your old booke, in which, long ſtudy hath made you perfect.
<pb facs="tcp:18234:216"/> Though your hearts were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ballanced with a mutuall and moſt entire affection, and the doubt inſoluble, which of you loued moſt; yet Death finding her weaker, though not the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker veſſell, layd his weight in her ballance, to bring her ſooneſt to her reſt. Let your mind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſent to that which your tongue daily craueth, that Gods will may be done, as well here in earth of her mortall body, as in that little heauen of her pureſt ſoule, ſith his will is the beſt meaſure of all euents. There is in this world continuall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of pleaſing and greeting accidents, ſtill keeping their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of times and ouertaking each other in their ſeuerall cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. No picture can be all drawne of the brighteſt colours, nor an harmonie conſorted onely of trebbles: ſhadowes are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in expreſſing of proportions, and the baſe is a principall part
<pb facs="tcp:18234:217"/> in perfect muſicke: the condition of our exile here alloweth no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled ioy, our whole life is temperate betweene ſweete and ſower and we muſt all looke for a mixture of both. The wiſe ſo wiſh: better that they ſtill thinke of worſe, accepting the one if it come with liking, and bearing the other without impatience, being ſo much maiſters of each others fortunes, that neither ſhall worke them to exceſſe. The dwarfe groweth not on the higheſt hill, nor the tall man lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not his height in the loweſt valley. And as a baſe minde, though moſt at eaſe, will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, ſo a reſolute vertue in the deepeſt diſtreſſe is moſt impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. They euermore moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly enioy their comforts, that leaſt feare their contraries: for a deſire to enioy, carieth with it a feare to loſe; and both deſire and feare are enemies to quiet poſſeſſion, making men rather
<pb facs="tcp:18234:217"/> owners of Gods benefits, then tenants at his will. The cauſe of our troubles are, that our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes hap, either to vnwitting or vnwilling minds. Foreſight pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth the one, neceſſity the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for he taketh away the ſmart of preſent euills that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth their comming, and is not amated with any croſſe, that is armed againſt all. Where neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie worketh without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the effect ſhould neuer greatly afflict vs, griefe being bootleſſe, where it cannot helpe, needleſſe where there was no fault. God caſteth the dice, and giueth vs our chance; the moſt we can do, is to take the poynt that the caſt will affoord vs, not grudging ſo much that it is no better, as comforting our ſelues it is no worſe. If men ſhould lay all their euils together, to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by equall portions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided among them, moſt men would rather take that they
<pb facs="tcp:18234:218"/> brought, then ſtand to the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yet ſuch is the partial iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſelfe loue, that euery man iudgeth his ſelfe-miſery too great, fearing if he can find ſome circumſtance to increaſe it, and making it intollerable, by thought to induce it. When <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> threw his rod from him, it became a ſerpent, ready to ſting, and affrighted him, inſomuch as it made him to flie, but being quietly taken vp, it was a rod a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſeruiceable for his vſe, no way hurtfull. The croſſe of Chriſt, and rod of euery tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion feeming to threaten ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and terrour to thoſe that ſhunne and eſchue it, but they that mildly take it vp and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it with patience, may ſay with <hi>Dauid,</hi> thy rod and thy ſtaffe haue bene my comfort.<note place="margin">Pſal. 12.</note> In this, affliction reſembleth the Crocadile; flie, it purſueth and frighteth; followed, it flieth and feareth, a ſhame to the conſtant,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:218"/> a tyrant to the timorous. Soft mindes that thinke onely vpon delights, admit no other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: but in ſoothing things become ſo effeminate, as that they are apt to bleed with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharpe impreſſion. But he that vſeth his thoughts with expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of troubles, making their trauell through all hazards, and appoſing his reſolution againſt the ſharpeſt encounters, findeth in the proofe facilitie of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and eaſeth the loade of moſt heauy combers. We muſt haue temporall things in vſe, but eternall in wiſh, that in the one neither delight exceede (in that we haue no deſire in that we want:) and in the other our moſt delight is here in deſire, and our whole deſire is hereafter to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy. They ſtraighten too much their ioyes, that draw them into the reach and compaſſe of their ſenſes, as if it were no facilitie where no ſenſe is witneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:219"/> whereas if we exclude our paſſed and future contentments, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant pleaſures haue ſo fickle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that either as foreſtalled before their arriuall, or interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before their end, or ended before they are well begun, the repetition of former comforts, and the expectation of after hopes, is euer a reliefe vnto a vertuous mind, whereas others, not ſuffering their life to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the conueniences of that which was and ſhall be deuided, this day from yeſterday and to morrow, and by forgetting all, and forecaſting nothing abridge their whole life into the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of preſent time. Enioy your ſiſter in her former vertues, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy her alſo in her future mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, being both titles of more certaine delights, than her caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life could euer haue warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If we will thinke of her de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th, let it be as a warning to prouide vs, ſith that what happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb facs="tcp:18234:219"/> to one, may happen to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yea, none can eſcape, that is common to all. It may be, that blow that hither, was meant to ſome of vs; and this miſſing was but a proofe to take better aime in the next ſtroke. If we were diligent in thinking of our own, we ſhould haue little leiſure to bewaile others death. When the ſouldier in skirmiſh ſeeth his next fellow ſlaine, he thinketh more time to looke to himſelfe, then to ſtand mourning an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe miſchance, knowing the hand which ſped ſo neare a neighbour, cannot be farre from his owne head. But we in this behalfe are much like the ſilly birds, that ſeeing one ſticke in the lime buſh, ſtriuing to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, with a kind of natiue pitty are drawen to go to it, and to ruſh themſelues into the ſame misfortune; euen ſo many for their friends deceaſſe by muſing on their lot, wittingly ſurfet of
<pb facs="tcp:18234:220"/> too much ſorrow, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they make mourning their laſt deceaſſe. But ſlippe not you into this toyle, that hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken none but weake affections; hold not your eyes alwayes vpon your hardeſt happes, neither be you ſtill occupied in counting your loſſes. There are fairer parts in your body than ſcarres, better eye-markes in your fortune than a ſiſters loſſe. You might haply find more comfort left, than you would willingly loſe; but that you haue already reſigned the ſolaces of life, and ſhunned all comforts into the hopes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; yet ſith there is ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene a purpoſe and proofe, intending and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, a ſubdued enemy being euer ready to rebell when he findeth mighty helpes to make a party, it is good to ſtrengthen reaſon againſt the violence of Nature that in this and like caſes will renew her aſſaults. It was
<pb facs="tcp:18234:220"/> a forcible remedie that he vſed to withſtand the conceit of a moſt lamentable occurrent, who hauing in one ſhip loſt his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſubſtance, and hardly eſcaped himſelfe from drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, went preſently into an hoſpitall of lazars, where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a little roome many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of great miſeries, he made the ſmart of others ſores a lenitiue to his owne wound. For beſides that, as lowneſſe and pouerty was common to them, they had alſo many combers pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate to themſelues, ſome wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their ſenſes, ſome their wits, other their limmes, but all their health: in which conſideration he eaſed his minde, that Fortune had not giuen him the greateſt fall. If God had put you to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> triall, commanding you to ſacrifice the hope of your poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and to be to your onely ſonne an authour of death, as you were to him of life: If you
<pb facs="tcp:18234:221"/> had bene tied in the ſtraights of <hi>Iepthaes</hi> bitter deuotions, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruing his ſword in his owne daughters bloud, and ending the triumphs ouer his enemies, with the voluntary funerals of his only ofſpring: yet, ſith both their liues &amp; their labours had bene Gods vndeniable debt, your vertues ought to haue obeyed, maugre all encounters of carnall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And how much more in this caſe ſhould you encline your loue to Gods liking, in which he hath receiued a leſſe part of his owne, and that by the vſuall eaſieſt courſe of natures lawes? Let God ſtrippe you to the skinne, yea to the ſoule, ſo he ſtay with you himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let his reproach be your honour, his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty your riches, and he, in lieu of all other friends. Thinke him enough for this world, that muſt be all your poſſeſſion for a whole eternity. Let others eaſe their carefullneſſe with borrowed
<pb facs="tcp:18234:221"/> pleaſures, not bred out of the true roote, but begged of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall helpes. They ſhall ſtill carry vnquiet mindes, eaſily altered with euery accident, ſith they labour not for any change in their inward diſtempers, but by forgetting them for a time by outward paſtimes. Innocencie is the onely mother of true mirth, and a ſoule that is owner of God, will quietly beare with all other wants nothing being able to empoueriſh it but voluntary loſſes. Beare not therefore with her loſſes, for ſhe is won for euer, but with the momentary abſence of your moſt happy ſiſter; yea it cannot iuſtly be called an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, many thoughts being dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in parley with her, onely mens eyes and eares vnworthy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy ſo ſweete an obiect, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned their intereſt, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted this treaſure in their harts, being the fitteſt ſhrines for ſo pure a Saint, whom, as none did
<pb facs="tcp:18234:222"/> know but did loue, ſo none can now remember but with deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Men may behold her with ſhame of their former life, ſeeing one of the weaker ſexe honor her weakneſſe with ſuch a traine of perfections. Ladies may admire her, as a glorie to their degree, in whom honour was portraied in her full likeneſſe, grace hauing perfected Natures firſt draught with all the due colours of an abſolute vertue. All women ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept her as a patterne to imitate her gifts and her good parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene ſo manifeſted, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen they that can teach the fineſt ſtitches, may themſelues take new workes out of this Sampler. Who then could drinke any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out of ſo cleare a Fountaine, or bewaile the eſtate of ſo happy a creature, to whom, as to be her ſelfe was her praiſe; ſo to be as ſhe is, was her higheſt bliſſe? You ſtill floate in a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome ſea, and you find it by
<pb facs="tcp:18234:222"/> experience a ſea of dangers: how then can it pitty you to ſee your ſiſter on ſhoare, and ſo ſafely lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſo blisfull an harbour?

Yea, you ſhould rather haue wiſhed to haue bene Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to let her in, than mourne to ſee her ſafe returned. For ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hazards, ſhe carried an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly treaſure in an earthly veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> which was too weake a treaſurie for ſo high riches: ſinne creeping in at the window of our ſenſes, and often picking the locks of the ſtrongeſt hearts. And for this it was layd vp in a ſurer, to the which the heauens are walles, and the Angels kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
<pb facs="tcp:18234:223"/> She was a pure fiſh, but yet ſwimming in muddy ſtreames: it was now time to draw her to ſhoare, and to employ the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of her vertues to medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vſes, that layd on the coals of due conſideration, they may draw from our thoughts, the Diuels ſuggeſtions, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their eyes,<note place="margin">Tob. 6.</note> which are blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the dung of flying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, the ſlime of their former vanities may fall off, and leaue them able to behold the cleare light. The baſe ſhell of a mortall body was vnfit for ſo precious a Margarite,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> and the Ieweller that came into this world to ſeeke good pearles, and gaue, not only all he had, but himſelfe alſo, to buy them, thought now high time to bring her vnto his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, finding her growne to a Margarites full perfection. She ſtood vpon too low a ground to take view of her Sauiours moſt deſired countenance, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                     <note place="margin">Luk. 9.</note> ſhe climed vp into the tree of life, there to giue her ſoule a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt of her beauties. She departed with <hi>Iepthaes</hi> daughter from her fathers houſe, but to paſſe ſome moneths in wandring about the mountaines of this troubleſome world, which being now expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſhe was after her pilgrimage, by couenant, to returne to be offered vnto God in a gratefull ſacrifice, and to aſcend out of this deſart like a ſtemme of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume out of burned ſpices. Let not therefore the crowne of her vertue be the foile of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, nor the end of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers a renewing of yours. But ſith God was well pleaſed to call her, ſhe not diſpleaſed to go, and you the third twiſt to make a triple cord, ſaying, Our Lord gaue, and our Lord tooke away, as it hath pleaſed our Lord, ſo hath it fallen out: the name of our Lord be bleſſed.</p>

                        <p>THE fourth affection is to endeuour as neare as I can to take occaſion of euery thing that I heare, ſee, or thinke of, to praiſe God: as if the things were good, then to praiſe God that he gaue grace to do them: and if the things were euill, to thanke God, that either he preſerued me or others from them, or at leaſt hath not ſuffered me to continue ſtill in them, or to be in his wrath condemned for them. Alſo I muſt conſider, and with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eye ſee God in euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how he worketh in all things to my benefit, and weigh how in all creatures both within and without me, he ſheweth his preſence by keeping them in their being, and courſe of nature, for without him they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turne to nothing; and I muſt aſſure my ſelfe, that in all this he hath as well regard to my
<pb facs="tcp:18234:240"/> good as to others, and therefore all creatures muſt be (as it were) bookes to me, to reade therein the loue, preſence, prouidence, and fatherly care that God hath ouer me.</p>

                        <p>THe fift affection is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that I being a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, not onely my faith and all my actions proper thereunto, ought to be different from the erronious opinions, ſectes and actions of infidels, but euen mine ordinary actions of eating, drinking, playing, working, and ſuch like, ought to haue a marke and badge of Chriſtianitie, and ſome difference from the like things done by heathens: and this marke which maketh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and good works, is a right and ſincere intention, which in euery principall action I ought
<pb facs="tcp:18234:241"/> to procure, ſo that it be done to the honour, glorie, and ſeruice of God; and agreeable to the rule of Chriſtian duty, with that meaſure, temperance, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that faith requires, perſwading my ſelfe, that as well in theſe actions done in this ſort, as in others that carry more ſhew of pietie, God may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and honoured, and therefore ſhould it be a great negligence and careleſneſſe in me for want of directing my intention (which by vſe is eaſily gotten) to loſe ſo many great vertues, as by theſe ordinarie actions I might daily and hourely gaine.</p>

                        <head>The ſixt Affection.</head>
                        <p>THe ſixt affection is a perfect reſignation of my ſelfe into Gods hands, with a full deſire that he ſhould vſe me as were moſt to his glorie, whether it
<pb facs="tcp:18234:241"/> were to my temporall comfort or no, and to be as ready to ſerue him in miſerie, need, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in proſperity and pleaſure, thinking it my chiefeſt delight, to be vſed as God will, and to haue his pleaſure and prouidence fully accompliſhed in me, which is the end for which I was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and for which I do liue. To attaine this reſignation, it is a very fit way to debate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with my ſelfe, what thing there is could happen vnto me, though neuer ſo much againſt my liking, which if it ſhould fall out would trouble me, or make me loſe that indifferencie which I ought to haue in moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeelding my ſelfe to whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God ſhall lay vpon me: and if I find any thing which I thinke I ſhould not well digeſt, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with due patience, let me endeuour to ouercome my ſelfe in it, and by prayer and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeeke to winne the difficulty
<pb facs="tcp:18234:242"/> thereof, that there may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which I could not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accept at Gods hands, how contrary ſoeuer it were to my inclination, to which theſe conſiderations may helpe me.</p>
                        <p>Firſt the end I ayme at, is Gods glory in this world, and his reward in the next: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing that nothing but my voluntary ſinne can barre me from this end, what need I much care by what meanes God will haue me to attaine it? for the meanes can laſt but a little, and the end endureth for euer, and is ſo much the more comfortable, in that it hath bene atchiued with diſcomfortable toyles.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, God loueth me more then I loue my ſelf, &amp; is ſo wiſe that he ſeeth what is fitteſt for me, all preſent and future cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered: he is ſo mightie that what his wiſedome and loue ſhall conclude for my good his power can put it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:242"/> and therfore let me yeeld my ſelfe rather to his prouidence then to mine owne deſires.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, whatſoeuer moueth me to feare or diſlike any thing, which I could not frame my minde to beare, God ſeeth it far better then I, yea and all other ſecret and vnknowne hazards annexed to that thing. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knowing all theſe things, will neuertheleſſe let it happen vnto me; I muſt aſſure my ſelfe that it proceedeth from loue, and is for my greater good, and that he hauing laid a heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vpon weake forces, will by his grace ſupply all my wants, feares and frailties.</p>

Which externall compoſition is neceſſary both for edifying our neighbour, who being vnable to iudge or enter into our thoughts, iudgeth of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one according to that whereof his ſenſe is witneſſe. And next in reſpect of God, who being euery where preſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in vs behauiour worthy of his ſight and company: and laſtly, in reſpect of our owne ſoule, this care of externall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie being an approued meanes to auoide infinite ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Of externall compoſition there be three chiefe pointes.
<pb facs="tcp:18234:244"/> Firſt the care of our countenance, gate, and geſture: Secondly, of our voyce and ſpeech: Thirdly, of our apparell and other adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                  <p>In countenance I muſt auoide an vnſtayed kind of varietie and often change, keeping as neare as I may, one ſetled tenour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, rather bent to ſmiling then heauineſſe, and free from frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſuch like vnſeemely diſtemper: neither ought I to alter countenance, but when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and iuſt cauſe moueth me to ſhew either mirth, ſorrow, diſlike, or compaſſion, or ſome other modeſt or temperate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>My gate ought to be graue, neither too ſwift, nor too ſlow, but with a meane and ſober pace: my geſture muſt be decent, free from affection or ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and from all ſhew of inward diſquietneſſe or vnordered paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which though I cannot
<pb facs="tcp:18234:244"/> chuſe but ſometimes feele, yet it is good (as much as I may) to conceale it, becauſe outward ſignes do feede the inward diſtemper and bewray to others my imperfections, to my diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and their euill enſample.</p>
                  <p>My voyce neither ought to be very loud, nor my laughter ſo vehement, as to be heard afarre off, both ſeemely and modeſt; for exceſſe in the voice, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate loudneſſe, are alwayes certaine ſignes of paſſion, and therefore ought not to be vſed but vpon ſome extraordinary neceſſitie. My ſpeech ought not to be ſo much as to make me be noted for talkatiue: yea it is good to be rather ſparing in words, and readier to heare then to ſpeake: but when occaſion forceth vnto much talke, I muſt ſpeake deliberatly without raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or leuitie, auoiding ouer many ieaſts, eſpecially bitter taunts, and ſharpe words: I muſt
<pb facs="tcp:18234:245"/> alſo take heed of affected ſpeech, and impertinent ceremonies, vſing ſuch affability, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient complements as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ciuility and vſuall curteſie requireth. Mine apparell muſt be free from lightneſſe, or more gaudineſſe then fitteth mine age, company, or calling; it muſt be decent and comely, not too o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, nor with any vnuſuall or new faſhioned dreſſes, that other graue perſons of my qualitie and calling (that are well thought of) do not vſe: it muſt be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and cleane, and as much as may be, without ſingularity, that therein the ſtayedneſſe and ſeemely eſtate of my ſoule may be perceiued. Alwayes when I am to go to any company, either of my dwelling place or ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, I ought to forecaſt their diſpoſition, and what talke or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is likely to be tendred vnto me by their preſence. If I feare any detracting ſpeeches let me
<pb facs="tcp:18234:245"/> arme my ſelfe, not to ſeeme to approue them, yea rather to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like them, and indeuour to turne their talke into ſome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo in all vnlawfull kind of ſpeech whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>Finally, let this for conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be my chiefe rule, alwayes to foreſee and prouide my ſelfe againſt the occaſions y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by euery companie are likely to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, &amp; in the beginning to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect mine intention, to talke ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for diſpatch of neceſſary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, (if there be any) or for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining mutual loue and charitie, if it be merrie or ordinary talke.</p>
                  <p>This foreſight of occaſions, and faults likely to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is the principall remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſinne, and therefore eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to be noted and vſed. To conclude, the vertues neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie in conuerſation are, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, decencie, curteſie, affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, meekneſſe, and ciuilitie, ſhew of compaſſion to others

                  <p>The vices chiefly to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are pride, diſdainefulneſſe, rudeneſſe, frowardneſſe, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, too much familiaritie, churliſhneſſe, and offenſiue ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, I muſt procure to foreſee in euery action (at leaſt in all the principall) to fore-arme my ſelfe againſt thoſe occaſions of ſinne that ſhall be offered in them: and where it lyeth not in my power to auoide the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any great ſinne, the more danger there is: and the greater the ſinne is that I am in danger of, ſo much the more preparation muſt I vſe to reſiſt it, &amp; the more earneſtly aske for Gods grace.</p>

I muſt take heed that they come not amongſt ſuch ſeruants as are like to teach them to ſweare, or any other vice, and I muſt giue ſpeciall warning that none do it. I muſt ſet honeſt and ſound perſons to gouerne them, that may alſo teach them vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet not truſting too much to my ſeruants care, but that I my ſelfe haue a ſpeciall eye ouer them, and take an account what they do. I muſt vſe them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion by little and little, not cloying them with too much at once, but rather ſeeking to make them take a delight in it. I muſt inſtruct them in the points of faith, and true religion, and
<pb facs="tcp:18234:251"/> teach them the Lords prayer, the Creede and the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I muſt keepe them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes occupied in ſome profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, allotting them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their age, more or leſſe time of recreation. I muſt often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times remember vnto them the paſſions and ſufferings of Chriſt for ſinne, with the benefit of his death and glorious reſurrection. I muſt breake them from their wills, and puniſh them as they deſerue: yet remembring alſo that they are yong, and not kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them in too much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, which may breed in them baſe and ſeruile minds, and make their loue leſſe towards me: and I neuer ought to beate any child in mine anger. I muſt procure that they be taught ſuch exerciſes and qualities, as are fit for thoſe of their degree, and yet haue chiefe care that good and honeſt perſons be about them. I muſt not vſe them to vaine
<pb facs="tcp:18234:252"/> dreſſes, and coſtly apparell, but rather often ſhew them the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie thereof, yet muſt they not be too ſtraite kept in that, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing, which they are afterward to haue, leſt the being too much barred from it make them more eager to haue it, when they come to enioy it at their owne will: I muſt vſe them to giue almes, to make much of the poore, and to vſe reuerence to aged perſons and ſpirituall men: I muſt vſe them to reade good bookes, ſuch as are fitteſt for their capacitie, and ſee them kept from vaine bookes of loue, and ſuch like idle diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that do peruert the minds of youth oftentimes for all their enſuing time after: I muſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them as they grow in yeares, to ſuffer aduerſity, and to digeſt griefe, eſpecially in Gods cauſe, and a good quarrell, telling them the examples of others, and how good a thing patience
<pb facs="tcp:18234:252"/> and coſtancie is.</p>
                  <p>When they are fit to go to ſchoole, I muſt procure that they haue diſcret and calme teachers, ſuch as are not cholerike, haſtie, or curſt, leſt they take diſlike and tediouſneſſe in learning; for they muſt be rather wonne vnto it by praiſe and emulation of others, then by bayting and ſtripes: I muſt ſee that they be taught ſuch ciuilitie, curteſie, and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as their degree and the time requireth, and frame them as much as may be, to be gentle, humble, and affable, euen to the meaneſt, rebuking them for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and ſharpe words, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefull behauiour, euen to their inferiors: I muſt not ſuffer the boyes and girles to be much together, eſpecially out of ſight, after eight or nine yeares of age, leſt they fall to vnhappineſſe: Likewiſe my daughters muſt not be amongſt the men, nor my ſonnes amongſt the women.
<pb facs="tcp:18234:253"/> When they come to ſuch age that they muſt of force be in many companies, I muſt procure ſome ſound and honeſt perſons to be for the moſt part with them, to enforme me of their courſes. I muſt make them in any wiſe to beware of lewd conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which is the ouerthrow of youth, and therefore cauſe this point to be beaten into them by good and zealous men. I muſt neuer aſſure or marrie them, vntill they be of ſufficient age to make their owne choiſe, and frame their liking: neither force them to any match, leſt they curſe me all their liues after, as it often happeneth.</p>

                     <p>THe firſt conſideration: How waightie a thing the buſineſſe of mans ſoule is. Whoſoeuer being deſirous to take due care of his ſoule, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing a ſpirituall courſe, muſt conſider that he hath taken ſuch a buſineſſe in hand, that for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, neceſſity and profit, ſummoneth all other traffickes and affaires of the world, yea, and to which onely all other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe ought to be addreſſed, for herein our menage is about the ſaluation of our ſoule, our chiefe iewell and treaſure, of which if in the ſhort paſſage of our brittle and vncertaine life we take not the due care that we ought for a whole eternity after, we ſhall euermore repent and be ſorrie for it, and yet neuer haue the
<pb facs="tcp:18234:265"/> like oportunitie againe to helpe it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the moment and waight of this buſineſſe, let vs conſider what men vſe to do for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health: for we ſee they make ſo principall a reckoning of it, they ſpare no coſt, nor toyle, nor leaue any thing vnattempted that may auaile them to attaine it. They ſuffer themſelues to be launced, wounded, pined, burnt with red hot irons, beſides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe other extreame torments onely for this end. How much greater miſeries ought we to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure? how much greater paines and diligence ought we to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy for this health of our ſoule, which is to ſuruiue when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is dead, rotten, and deuoured with wormes? And to ſuruiue in ſuch ſort, that it muſt be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tormented in hell with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable torments, or enioy endleſſe felicitie in heauen: And
<pb facs="tcp:18234:266"/> therefore of how much greater worth and waight we thinke the ſoule, and the eternall ſaluation or damnation thereof, then the momentarie health or ſickneſſe of our bodies, ſo much greater account and eſteeme ought we to make of the buſineſſe of our ſoule, then of any other worldly or bodily affaire whatſoeuer.</p>
                     <p>For what auaileth it a man (ſaith Chriſt) to gaine the whole world, and make wracke of his ſoule? If therefore we keepe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers men for diuers offices about our bodie, and many thouſands do liue by ſeruing and prouiding things for euery part thereof: If we ſpend ſo much time in fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, refreſhing, and repoſing the ſame: If the greateſt portion of our reuenewes (be they neuer ſo large) be conſumed in the meates, pompe, ſports, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof, how much more ought we to ſeeke as many helpes, ſeruices and purueyers
<pb facs="tcp:18234:266"/> for our ſoule, for whoſe onely ſake our bodie was giuen, and of whoſe good the welfare of the body onely proceedeth? Thirdly, the neceſſitie and poiſe of this care of our ſoule may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this, that all other matters are intreated with men, or ſome other creatures, but this buſineſſe of our ſoule with God himſelfe, who, by how much he is nobler &amp; worthier then any of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo much more is the weight of this matter, and cannot be dealt with any without him: and ſo much more diligence ought there to be employed therein, eſpecially in this time wherein God is ſtill ready to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our endeuours in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, whereas when time is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, condemne he may for our negligence, or reward vs for our carefulneſſe, but not helpe vs any more to alter the ſtate of our ſoule, be it neuer ſo miſerable.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, we may gather how
<pb facs="tcp:18234:267"/> materiall and important this matter is, by the life of Chriſt and his Saints, who withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues from all other worldly affaires, thought it work enough to attend to this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſoule: and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at this day are honoured in Gods Church, they are honoured onely in this, that they haue with a glorious concluſion happily and conſtantly, accompliſhed this buſineſſe to Gods glorie and their owne ſaluation: and who ſo conſidereth the intollerable torm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ts of Martyrs, the paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full agonies, conflicts, rough ſtormes, and troubles of all Gods Saints, and doth remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber withall, that they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke them for no other reſpect, but onely for the better bringing this buſineſſe of their ſoule to an end, it will ſoone appeare how waighty a thing and how preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the ſaluation of the ſoule is, which they did thinke nothing
<pb facs="tcp:18234:267"/> too deare bought with all the miſeries, ſorrowes and paines that this world could affoord. Let vs alſo conſider that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer moued them to ſuch care and earneſtneſſe in this behalfe, hath no leſſe place in vs doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe then in them, ſeeing that our ſoule is as deare bought, as much worth, and created to as great glorie as theirs: the danger of our ſaluation rather more, then any way leſſe then theirs.

                        </gap>, and we as many titles of bond and dutie to ſerue him as they. Finally we are aſſaulted by the ſame enemies, enuironed with the like hazardes, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to as many, yea more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſinne, and allurements to damnation then they. Who therefore ſeeth not that we are in euery reſpect to account the care of our ſoules as important and neceſſarie to vs as euer it hath bene to any? <hi>Wherefore let

But let him that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, glorie in this, that he knoweth me, for I am the onely Lord that worketh mercy, iudgement, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice vpon the earth, and theſe things pleaſe me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> As who would ſay, it is follie and vanitie to glotie and reioyce in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſeruice of God, and procuring mercy and mild iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our ſoules.</p>

                     <p>FIrſt, ſeeing this buſineſſe of our ſoule is of ſo great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he that earneſtly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about the ſame muſt offer himſelfe vp vnto God, and be moſt ready to endure conſtantly all the dangers, combers and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that ſhall happen, and reſolue neuer by Gods grace to be diſmayed and beaten backe from his purpoſe by any trouble or encounter whatſoeuer, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that glorious and honorable enterpriſes can neuer be atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without many contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Wherefore let him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelfe that when he hath ſetled his mind ſeriouſly to
<pb facs="tcp:18234:269"/> follow this buſineſſe, Hell it ſelfe, and all the enemies of God and mans ſoule will conſpire againſt him: The fleſh to allure him to delights of the ſenſes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to the vomit of his abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pleaſures: The world to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice him with pompes and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with miniſtring occaſion of ſinne, and prouoking by euill examples: Yea, if that will not ſerue, by terrifying him with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, extortions, obloquies, ſlanders, and torments, and with all kinde of diſgrace. Finally, the diuell (a profeſſed enemie to all that take care of their ſoules) will ſeeke to intrap him with a thouſand traines, paſſions, and ſubtill temptations, leauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he thinketh may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue a man from theſe ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, tending to his ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the caſe ſtanding thus, let that ſaying of Scripture come to our mind: <hi>My ſonne comming to the ſeruice of God,
<pb facs="tcp:18234:269"/> ſtand in iuſtice and feare, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy ſoule vnto temptation.</hi> Wherefore he that entreth into the way of life, muſt remember that he is not come to a play, paſtime, or pleaſure, but to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall rough battaile and fight, againſt moſt vnplacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And let him reſolue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, neuer in this world to look for quiet and peace, no not ſo much as for any truce for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, but arme himſelfe for a perpetuall combat, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke of a multitude of happie victories (which by Gods grace he may attaine) then of any repoſe or quietneſſe from the rage and aſſaults of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Let him ſee and peruſe the patterne of his Captaines courſe, who from his birth to his death was in a reſtleſſe battaile, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in his ſwathling cloutes by <hi>Herod,</hi> annoyed the reſt of his infancy by baniſhment, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and neede: In the flower
<pb facs="tcp:18234:270"/> of his age, ſlandered, hated, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, whipped, crucified, and moſt barbarouſly miſuſed. In the ſame ſort were all his Apoſtles, and all his principall ſouldiers handled: for whom he loueth he chaſtiſeth, and proueth like gold in the fornace. And therefore no man muſt thinke it a new thing to be tempted and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when he once runneth a vertuous courſe, contrary to the liking of his enemies. For, <hi>The Diſciple is not aboue his maiſter, nor the ſeruant aboue his Lord:</hi> who as we ſee had the ſame intreaty.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, leſt we ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſte and diſcouraged at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and feare of ſo many diſcomforts, and the vnceſſant malice of ſo ſpitefull enemies, let vs remember the words of <hi>Elizeus, That more ſtand with vs then againſt vs.</hi> Againſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature we haue grace. Againſt the Diuell we haue God, who will neuer ſuffer vs to be
<pb facs="tcp:18234:270"/> tempted aboue our force and ſtrength: Againſt the power of hell we haue the prayers of the faithfull: Againſt the miſeries of the body we haue the ſpirituall comfort of the minde, which God allotteth in ſuch meaſure as our neceſſity requireth: and if there were nothing elſe, this were enough to make troubles welcome in this caſe, for that thereby we purchaſe an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable glory (for a ſhort paſſing combat) the comfort whereof neither eye hath ſeene, eare hath heard, nor any heart conceiued. And on the other ſide, by the ſame we auoide other intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eternall torments of hell, the leaſt whereof paſſeth all thoſe that can be ſuffered in the world, and therefore is our change moſt happie, that by the paine of a ſhort life, auoide the miſery of an eternall death, and deſerue the vnſpeakeable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the life euerlaſting. For
<pb facs="tcp:18234:271"/> this cauſe (ſaith Saint <hi>Iames) Thinke you it all ioy my brethren, when you ſhall fall into diuerſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, knowing that the triall of your faith worketh patience, and patience hath a perfect worke, that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.</hi>

                     <p>SEeing this waightie affaire of our ſoules health, is hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in and beſet with ſo manifeſt perils and troubles, it ſtandeth vs vpon moſt watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to take heede to euery thought, word, and deed, that paſſeth, leſt through the number and ſubtilties of enemies traines, we be often entrapped: for it is hard to touch pitch and not be
<pb facs="tcp:18234:271"/> defiled, to liue in fleſh a ſpirituall life, to conuerſe in the world without worldly affections. Wherefore as a Legate that is to deliuer his embaſſage before a great preſence of Peeres and Nobles, hath not onely regard to his matter, but alſo to his words, voyee, and actions, that all be ſutable to his meſſage: ſo we hauing to worke this exploit of our ſoule before God and all the court of heauen, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of thoſe that lay waite to take vs in any trippe, ought to be very warie, euen in our leaſt thoughts and deeds, for feare leſt we offend the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and giue occaſion of triumph and victorie vnto our deadly foes. And for this ſaith the Scripture: <hi>Keepe thy ſelfe very watchfully.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, to attaine this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and attentiue care in all our actions: let vs conſider what men vſe to do that carry great
<pb facs="tcp:18234:272"/> treaſure by places haunted with theeues, how warily they looke to their way, how often they turne about them; how many times they prepare themſelues, ſometimes to fight, and other whiles to runne away. Likewiſe how warily he walketh, and how carefull he is neuer to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor fall that carieth in each hand a thinne glaſſe of precious liquour, through ſtony and rough places: and when we haue marked theſe mens carefulneſſe in theſe inferior matters, let vs remember that much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is neceſſarie in vs, whoſe treaſure is more precious then any worldly iewels, and yet do we carrie it in earthen and fraile veſſels, in the middeſt of ſo many theeues as there are paſſions and diſordered appetites in vs, as there are Diuels in waite for vs, and as there are ſtumbling ſtones and occaſions of ſinne ſet round about vs to procure this
<pb facs="tcp:18234:272"/> attention: the moſt effectuall helpes are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt to thinke how carefull we ſhould be to do all things well, if this preſent day were the laſt that euer we ſhould liue in this world (as peraduenture it may be) and that at the end thereof we were to be conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before a moſt ſeuere and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Iudge, who according to the deſert of that dayes acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould paſſe the ſentence of life or death vpon vs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to remember that God is in his owne ſubſtance, power, and true preſence in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, and ſeeth both our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward actions more then we our ſelues, and therefore let vs ſeeke in euery thing ſo to behaue our ſelues, that we feare not to haue God a witneſſe and beholder of all that we do, thinke, or ſay, and let vs aske him grace to do nothing vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie his fight.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18234:273"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, we muſt conſider the careleſneſſe of our life paſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring how often we haue fought againſt God with his owne weapons, and abuſed the force that he hath affoorded, in euery part of our body and minde: and therefore as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> warneth, <hi>As we haue exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited our members to ſerue vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and iniquitie, ſo let vs now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite our members to ſerue iuſtice vnto ſanctification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, to procure this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, it is good oftentimes in the day when we ate about our ordinary actions, to vſe godly prayers, and ſome verſes out of the Pſalmes, with petition vnto God for his grace, aide and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: for ſuch godly exerciſes are fewell of deuotion, cauſes of attention, foode of the ſoule, preparatiues againſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and aſſured helpes to attaine any vertues. Therefore it is good to vſe them in lieu of ſightes, and
<pb facs="tcp:18234:273"/> in the beginning of euery chiefe action, directing therein our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and action, to Gods glory and ſeruice, and our owne foules good health and fafetie.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, the end of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe was to ſerue God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile my former ſinnes, and to worke by Gods helpe the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of mine owne ſoule: and when I reſolued vpon theſe meanes I was free from paſſion, and as well able to chuſe things conuenient as I could at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, and wholly bent to do that thing which was for my greateſt good.

                     <p>Thirdly, I muſt conſider who is that, that would make me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it: for if God moued me vnto it, doubtleſſe it is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell would moue me from it, for God cannot be contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, neither vſeth he to alter our minds, but onely from euill to good, or from good to better: therefore vnleſſe I meane to yeeld willingly to the Diuell, and to follow mine enemies counſell to mine owne perdition, I muſt perſeuer vnto the end: for with what pretext ſoeuer the Diuell ſeeketh to couer his motion, ſure it is that his drift is to draw me from God and goodneſſe, and to damne my ſoule: for how can he intend any thing for my good, that beareth me ſuch a

                     <p>Fourthly, I muſt print that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt in my minde: <hi>He that perſeuereth vnto the end ſhall be ſaued:</hi> for not he that begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, nor he that continueth for a moneth, or a yeare, or a ſhort time, but onely he that perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto the end of his life ſhall be ſaued.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore the ſame cauſe that moued me to beginne, ought alſo to moue me to continue, that the reward and crowne of my good reſolution be not cut off by any want of perſeuerance. Let not the cries of mine enemies moue me: let me with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>The world is crucified to me, and I to the world:</hi> And with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, It is good for me to cleane vnto God.</hi> Finally, let me imitate the enſample of Chriſt, that perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:18234:275"/> on the croſſe vnto death for my ſake, though often called vpon to come downe.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, I muſt conſider that in what ſtate ſo euer of grace, or merit of damnation I beginne the next life, I muſt and ſhall vndoubtedly perſeuer in it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the words of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: Whereſoeuer the tree falleth there ſhall it be, whether it be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards South or North, that is, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heauen or hell:</hi> for both the paine of this continueth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and the ioy of the other is alſo euerlaſting.</p>
                     <p>If therefore I will perſeuer in heauen, let me perſeuer in the way that leadeth vnto it, and neuer forſake the painefulneſſe of it vnto the iourneyes end. The paſſions of this life are not condigne and comparable to the future glorie: and it is extreame follie for auoiding a ſhort and tranſitorie paine, to hazard the loſſe of euerlaſting ioy, and put
<pb facs="tcp:18234:276"/> my ſelfe in perill of perpetuall bondage, in ſarre more extreame and endleſſe torments. The ſinners perſeuer ſtill in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſeruice of the Diuell. The worldlings perſeuer in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing vanities, and following the world, yea and that with moſt ſeruile toile, and baſe drudgerie, and not without many bodily and ghoſtly harmes: how much more ought a true ſeruant of God perſeuer in Gods ſeruice, and not ſeeme by forſaking him in the way, to condemne him for a worſe maiſter then the world or the Diuell, whom many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſerue to the end, to their owne damnation. Let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the firſt Angell for want of perſeuerance became a diuell. <hi>Adam</hi> for want of the ſame was thruſt out of Paradiſe, and <hi>Iudas</hi> of an Apoſtle became a prey of hell. Finally, there be many thouſands in hell fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that beganne very good
<pb facs="tcp:18234:276"/> courſes, and for a time went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the ſame, and yet in the end, for want of perſeuerance were damned for euer.</p>

                  <p>O Moſt mightie Lord and Creator of all things, when I thinke with my ſelfe how grieuouſly I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thine infinite Maieſtie with my ſinnes, I wonder at mine owne follie: when I conſider what a louing and bountifull father I haue forſaken, I accurſe mine ingratitude: when I behold how I am fallen from ſuch a noble libertie into ſuch a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bondage, I condemne my ſelfe for an inconſtant foole, and know not what other thing I may ſet before mine eyes, but onely hell and damnation for
<pb facs="tcp:18234:279"/> ſo much as thy iuſtice (from which I cannot flie) putteth a great tetror into my conſcience: but contrariwiſe when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy great mercie, which (as the Prophet witneſſeth) excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all thy workes, then do I feele forthwith a freſh and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant aire of hope, to refreſh and ſtrengthen againe my weake and ſorrowfull ſoule. Wherefore ſhould I then diſpaire to obtaine pardon of him who hath ſo often times in the holy Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited ſinners to repentance, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>I deſire not the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but that he ſhould liue and be conuerted.</hi> Moreouer, thine onely begotten Sonne, our ſweete Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt hath reuealed vnto vs by many parables, how ready and willing thou art to graunt pardon vnto all ſuch as are penitent for their ſinnes. This he ſignifieth vnto vs by the Iewell loſt, and found againe. By the ſtrayed ſheepe brought
<pb facs="tcp:18234:279"/> home againe vpon the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards ſhouldiers: and much more by the compariſon of the prodigall ſonne, whoſe liuely image I do acknowledge in my ſelfe, for I am he that hath moſt vniuſtly forſaken thee, my louing father, and haue riotouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed my ſubſtance, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the appetites of my fleſh, haue diſobeyed thy commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by breaking of them, haue fallen into the moſt filthie priſon of ſinne, being brought to extreame miſerie, out of which I know none other that can helpe me, but onely thou my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, whom I haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken. Receiue therefore (O Lord) mercifully the humble, that deſireth pardon of thee, whom thou haſt ſo patiently looked for, euen vntill this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent houre. Alas I am not worthy to lift vp mine eyes vnto thee, nor once to call thee father, but for ſo much as thou art a true fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

For this repentance and ſorrow for my ſinnes I had not had, if thou hadſt not beheld me with thy mercies eye. When I went wandring afarre off from thee, thou didſt looke downe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from heauen vpon me, and didſt open mine eyes that I might ſee my ſelfe, and take a view how full fraught I was with infinite ſinnes, and euen at this inſtant thou commeſt to receiue me againe, giuing me knowledge and mindfulneſſe of mine innocencie which I haue loſt. I do not requeſt thy moſt ſweete embracings and kiſſes: nor the rich garment that was wont to cloth me: neither yet the ring of mine ancient digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
<pb facs="tcp:18234:280"/> I ſue not to be receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the ſtate and dignitie of thy ſonnes: but thou ſhalt do very much for me, in caſe it may pleaſe thee to number me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt thy bondſlaues, and ſo to marke me with thy ſigne, and to fetter me with thy chaines, that I may neuer after runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from thee.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it ſhall neuer grieue me to be in this life one of the moſt abiect ſlaues in thy houſe, ſo that I may neuer be ſeparated from thee. Suffer me not gracious Lord to runne the erring ſteps that I haue formerly done: for thou didſt conſecrate me for thy temple, and I made my ſelfe an habitation for the Diuell: Thou gaueſt me armour, and didſt bind me to be thy true knight, and I haue gone traiterouſly to thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſide, vſing thine owne weapons againſt thee; thou didſt eſpouſe my ſoule vnto thee in perpetuall charitie, and I haue

<pb facs="tcp:18234:287"/> thy ſteps, thou madeſt it of a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and rough, an eaſie and beaten way. So becameſt thou vnto vs a way, that knoweth no errour, in which leſt we ſhould be wearied, thy bounty with great &amp; aſſured promiſes, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to aſſure vs: for who could be wearied, that thinketh how in following thy footſteps there is an heritage of eternall life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him? Therefore whilſt we are in this iourney, thou wouldeſt in ſtead of a ſtaffe be an aſſured hope vnto vs whereby we might be ſuſtained.</p>
                     <p>Neither was thy goodneſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented herewith, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the frailty of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in the meane ſpace with the comfort of the holy Spirit thou repaireſt our courages, to the end that we may more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly run vnto thee. And as thou being made a way vnto vs driueſt away all errour, ſo becoming our truth, thou takeſt away al diſtruſt.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18234:288"/>
                     <p>Finally, being made life vnto vs, thou giueſt heate vnto thoſe that are dead in ſinne, a life through thy holy Spirit which quickeneth all things, vntill all mortality laid aſide, in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection we may alwaies liue with thee and in thee, by reaſon that thou art vnto vs all in all things: For it is eternall life to know the Father, and the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, to be one true God. Wherefore I beſeech thee, O moſt mercifull Father, to increaſe faith in me who am thy vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie ſeruant, leſt at any time I wauer in thy celeſtiall doctrine: increaſe obedience in me, leſt I ſwerue from thy precepts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe conſtancy, that walking in thy waies, I neither be allured by the inticements of Satan, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by his terrors: but that I may perſeuere in thee who art rhe true way, to my liues end. Increaſe my faith, that poſſeſſed of thy promiſes, I may neuer
<pb facs="tcp:18234:288"/> waxe ſlow in the ſtudy of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but forgetting thoſe things I haue left behind me, I may alwaies ſtriue and endeuour for more perfection.</p>
                     <p>Increaſe thy grace in me, that daily more and more being mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified my ſelfe: I may liue and be incouraged by thy holy Spirit, fearing nothing but thee, than whom there is nothing more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, glorying in none but in thee, who art the true glorie of all the Saints, wiſhing nothing but thee, than whom there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better: deſiring nothing but thee, who art full and perfect felicitie, with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, world without end. Amen.</p>
